# Minimal Template

Bare essentials. Just the spec folder structure, nothing else.

## What's Included

- Spec folder structure (`specs/YYYYMMDD/NNN-name/`)
- That's it

## When to Use

- You want maximum flexibility
- Adding LeanSpec to existing project with established practices
- Don't need AI agent instructions

## Next Steps

Create your first spec: `lean-spec create my-feature`
