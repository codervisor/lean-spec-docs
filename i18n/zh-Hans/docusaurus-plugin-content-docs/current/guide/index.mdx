# What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a lightweight **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology designed for the AI era. It helps teams—both humans and AI agents—focus on *intent* rather than implementation details.

> **Think of it as "Markdown for Project Management"**: Simple, structured, and machine-readable.

## What You Get

*   [**Core CLI**](/docs/guide/usage/cli/creating-managing): Manage specs, track status, and visualize dependencies (`lean-spec board`, `lean-spec deps`).
*   [**MCP Server**](/docs/guide/usage/mcp-integration): Give AI agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.) direct access to read and search your specs.
*   [**Visual Mode**](/docs/guide/visual-mode): A beautiful web interface for browsing your project's spec graph (`lean-spec ui`).

## A Simple Example

A LeanSpec is just a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown title="./specs/001-user-auth-api/README.md"

# User Authentication API

## Goal
Enable secure user login and session management for the mobile app.

## Key Scenarios
1. User logs in with email/password → receives JWT token
2. User accesses protected endpoint with token → gets data
3. User token expires → receives 401, must re-authenticate

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login endpoint returns valid JWT on success
- [ ] JWT includes user ID and expiration
- [ ] Protected endpoints verify JWT signature

## Non-Goals
- Social login (future feature)
- Password reset (separate spec)
```

You can use your favorite AI coding tools to read this spec and generate code, documentation, or even test cases based on it.

## Next Steps

*   **[Getting Started](/docs/guide/getting-started)**: Install the CLI and create your first spec.
*   **[Why LeanSpec?](/docs/guide/why-leanspec)**: Understand the benefits of LeanSpec over other tools.
*   **[Understanding LeanSpec](/docs/guide/understanding-leanspec)**: Dive deeper into the "Context Economy" philosophy.
*   **[AI Integration](/docs/guide/usage/mcp-integration)**: Connect LeanSpec to your AI coding assistant.
