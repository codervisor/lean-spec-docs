# Detailed Template

For complex specs that benefit from structured sub-specs. Demonstrates how to manage token limits.

## What's Included

- **AGENTS.md** - Same AI agent instructions as standard template
- **Sub-spec structure** - README.md + DESIGN.md + PLAN.md + TEST.md
- Demonstrates splitting specs to stay under token limits
- Example of real-world sub-spec organization

## When to Use

- Complex features with lots of detail
- Specs approaching 3,500+ tokens
- Need clear separation of concerns (design, plan, test)
- Large teams with multiple reviewers

## Philosophy

Keep it lean, but organized. Use sub-specs to manage complexity without overwhelming context. Each file stays focused and under token limits.

## Next Steps

1. Customize AGENTS.md for your project
2. Create your first spec: `lean-spec create my-feature`
3. When a spec grows large, split sections into sub-spec files
