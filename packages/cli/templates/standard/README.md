# Standard Template

Recommended for most projects. Single-file specs with AI agent instructions.

## What's Included

- **AGENTS.md** - Instructions for AI coding assistants
- **Single-file spec template** - All sections in one README.md
- Opinionated defaults for fast iteration

## When to Use

- Solo developers or small teams
- Simple to moderate complexity specs
- Want AI agent integration
- Need clear but not heavy-weight process

## Philosophy

Keep it lean. Write specs for features that need clarity. Skip them for obvious changes.

## Next Steps

1. Customize AGENTS.md for your project
2. Create your first spec: `lean-spec create my-feature`
