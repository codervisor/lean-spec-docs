**Status Update Triggers (CRITICAL):**
- ✅ **Before starting implementation** → Update to `in-progress`
- ✅ **Immediately after completing all work** → Update to `complete`
- ✅ **If blocked or paused** → Update status and document why in spec
- ❌ **NEVER skip status updates** - They're required for project tracking
