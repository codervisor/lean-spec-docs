# LeanSpec

A lightweight, agile Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology designed to reduce spec "mind burden" and keep teams—both humans and AI coding agents—focused on what truly matters.

## The Problem

Traditional software specifications often suffer from:
- **Documentation Overload**: Lengthy documents that nobody (human or AI) reads or maintains
- **Frozen Contracts**: Specs that become outdated as soon as development begins
- **Exhaustive Overthinking**: Trying to document every possible edge case upfront
- **Mind Burden**: Cognitive load from managing verbose, complicated documentation
- **Lost Intent**: The "why" gets buried under mountains of "what" and "how"

Development teams—including AI coding agents—need clear direction without being buried in documentation debt.

## The LeanSpec Solution

LeanSpec is a **mindset and methodology, not a rigid format or tool**. It's about capturing what truly matters with minimal overhead.

A simple example structure might include:
- **The Goal**: Why this work exists
- **Key Scenarios**: The critical user journeys that must succeed
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for "done"
- **Technical Contracts**: Essential interfaces and constraints
- **Non-Goals**: What we're explicitly not doing (to maintain focus)

But the key is the mindset: focus on clarity, keep it lean, make it living documentation. The structure should serve your needs, not constrain them.

## Agile Principles

LeanSpec is built on these core principles:

### 🎯 Clarity over Documentation
Write just enough to communicate intent clearly. If it doesn't add clarity, don't write it.

### 🚀 Essential Scenarios over Exhaustive Lists
Focus on the 20% of scenarios that deliver 80% of the value. Document what must work, not every possible edge case.

### 📱 Living Guide over Frozen Contract
Specs should evolve with the project. Update them as you learn, don't treat them as immutable contracts.

### 🧠 Reduced Mind Burden over Comprehensive Coverage
Keep specs short and scannable. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, not create reference manuals.

### ⚡ Speed over Perfection
Ship a "good enough" spec quickly. You can always refine it based on feedback and learning.

### 🤝 Collaboration over Specification
Use specs as conversation starters, not as replacements for human communication.

## Getting Started

The LeanSpec mindset is simple:

1. **Start with why**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Capture the essentials**: What absolutely must be communicated?
3. **Stay lean**: If it doesn't add clarity, cut it
4. **Keep it living**: Update as you learn

For a practical example, see [LEANSPEC_TEMPLATE.md](LEANSPEC_TEMPLATE.md)—but remember, it's just one way to apply the methodology. Adapt the structure to fit your needs and context.

## When to Use LeanSpec

**Perfect for:**
- New features or components
- API designs
- Architecture decisions that need shared understanding
- Quick alignment on work direction
- Providing context to AI coding agents for implementation tasks

**Not ideal for:**
- Detailed API reference documentation (use code comments + auto-generated docs)
- Step-by-step user manuals (use dedicated user documentation)
- Compliance requirements that mandate specific formats

## LeanSpec for AI Coding Agents

In the era of AI-assisted development, the LeanSpec mindset is particularly valuable for communicating intent to AI coding agents:

- **Clear Context**: Starting with "why" gives AI agents the purpose behind the work
- **Concrete Scenarios**: Specific examples help AI understand expected behavior
- **Testable Criteria**: Clear targets guide AI implementation
- **Boundaries**: Explicit non-goals help AI avoid scope creep
- **Adaptable Structure**: Whatever format you choose, consistency helps AI parse effectively

AI coding agents work best with clear, concise specifications that balance context with brevity—exactly what the LeanSpec mindset promotes.

## Philosophy

> "The best spec is the one that gets read, understood, and acted upon—by humans and AI alike."

LeanSpec is a mindset, not a format. It embraces agile thinking: start small, iterate based on feedback, and focus on outcomes over outputs. A one-page spec that everyone (including AI coding agents) understands beats a fifty-page document that nobody reads.

The methodology is about principles over process—adapt it to your team, your tools, and your context.
