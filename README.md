# LeanSpec

A lightweight, agile Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology designed to reduce spec "mind burden" and keep teams focused on what truly matters.

## The Problem

Traditional software specifications often suffer from:
- **Documentation Overload**: Lengthy documents that nobody reads or maintains
- **Frozen Contracts**: Specs that become outdated as soon as development begins
- **Exhaustive Overthinking**: Trying to document every possible edge case upfront
- **Mind Burden**: Cognitive load from managing verbose, complicated documentation
- **Lost Intent**: The "why" gets buried under mountains of "what" and "how"

Development teams need clear direction without being buried in documentation debt.

## The LeanSpec Solution

LeanSpec is a **methodology, not a tool**. It provides a minimal framework for capturing what matters:
- **The Goal**: Why this work exists
- **Key Scenarios**: The critical user journeys that must succeed
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for "done"
- **Technical Contracts**: Essential interfaces and constraints
- **Non-Goals**: What we're explicitly not doing (to maintain focus)

That's it. No more, no less.

## Agile Principles

LeanSpec is built on these core principles:

### 🎯 Clarity over Documentation
Write just enough to communicate intent clearly. If it doesn't add clarity, don't write it.

### 🚀 Essential Scenarios over Exhaustive Lists
Focus on the 20% of scenarios that deliver 80% of the value. Document what must work, not every possible edge case.

### 📱 Living Guide over Frozen Contract
Specs should evolve with the project. Update them as you learn, don't treat them as immutable contracts.

### 🧠 Reduced Mind Burden over Comprehensive Coverage
Keep specs short and scannable. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, not create reference manuals.

### ⚡ Speed over Perfection
Ship a "good enough" spec quickly. You can always refine it based on feedback and learning.

### 🤝 Collaboration over Specification
Use specs as conversation starters, not as replacements for human communication.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the [LEANSPEC_TEMPLATE.md](LEANSPEC_TEMPLATE.md) template
2. Fill in the five sections with the minimum information needed
3. Share it with your team for feedback
4. Update it as you learn more during development
5. Keep it short—if your spec is longer than 2 pages, you're probably overthinking it

## When to Use LeanSpec

**Perfect for:**
- New features or components
- API designs
- Architecture decisions that need shared understanding
- Quick alignment on work direction

**Not ideal for:**
- Detailed API reference documentation (use code comments + auto-generated docs)
- Step-by-step user manuals (use dedicated user documentation)
- Compliance requirements that mandate specific formats

## Philosophy

> "The best spec is the one that gets read, understood, and acted upon."

LeanSpec embraces agile thinking: start small, iterate based on feedback, and focus on outcomes over outputs. A one-page spec that everyone understands beats a fifty-page document that nobody reads.
