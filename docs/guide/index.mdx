# What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a lightweight, agile Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology and adaptive workflow designed to reduce spec "mind burden" and keep teams—both humans and AI coding agents—focused on what truly matters.

> **LeanSpec is not just a document—it's an adaptive workflow, SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), and living process for AI-powered development teams.**

## The Problem

Traditional software specifications often suffer from:

- **Documentation Overload**: Lengthy documents that nobody (human or AI) reads or maintains
- **Frozen Contracts**: Specs that become outdated as soon as development begins
- **Exhaustive Overthinking**: Trying to document every possible edge case upfront
- **Mind Burden**: Cognitive load from managing verbose, complicated documentation
- **Lost Intent**: The "why" gets buried under mountains of "what" and "how"

Development teams—including AI coding agents—need clear direction without being buried in documentation debt.

## The LeanSpec Solution

LeanSpec is a **mindset and methodology, not a rigid format or tool**. It's about capturing what truly matters with minimal overhead.

A simple example structure might include:

- **The Goal**: Why this work exists
- **Key Scenarios**: The critical user journeys that must succeed
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for "done"
- **Technical Contracts**: Essential interfaces and constraints
- **Non-Goals**: What we're explicitly not doing (to maintain focus)

But the key is the **mindset**: focus on clarity, keep it lean, make it living documentation. The structure should serve your needs, not constrain them.

## Key Benefits

### For Development Teams

- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Short, scannable specs that are easy to understand
- **Faster Onboarding**: New team members quickly grasp project direction
- **Better Alignment**: Everyone shares the same understanding
- **Living Documentation**: Specs stay current as requirements evolve
- **Focus on Outcomes**: Emphasis on "what" and "why" over implementation details

### For AI Coding Agents

- **Clear Context**: Starting with "why" gives AI agents the purpose behind the work
- **Concrete Scenarios**: Specific examples help AI understand expected behavior
- **Testable Criteria**: Clear targets guide AI implementation
- **Boundaries**: Explicit non-goals help AI avoid scope creep
- **Adaptable Structure**: Whatever format you choose, consistency helps AI parse effectively

AI coding agents work best with clear, concise specifications that balance context with brevity—exactly what the LeanSpec mindset promotes.

## A Simple Example

Here's an example structure (adapt sections to your needs):

```markdown

status: in-progress
created: 2025-11-07
tags: [api, feature]
priority: high

# User Authentication API

## Goal
Enable secure user login and session management for the mobile app.

## Key Scenarios
1. User logs in with email/password → receives JWT token
2. User accesses protected endpoint with token → gets data
3. User token expires → receives 401, must re-authenticate

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login endpoint returns valid JWT on success
- [ ] JWT includes user ID and expiration
- [ ] Protected endpoints verify JWT signature
- [ ] Expired tokens are rejected with 401

## Technical Contracts
- Endpoint: POST /api/auth/login
- Token expiration: 24 hours
- Password hashing: bcrypt

## Non-Goals
- Social login (future feature)
- Password reset (separate spec)
- Two-factor auth (not needed yet)
```

Clean, focused, and actionable.

## Philosophy

> "The best spec is the one that gets read, understood, and acted upon—by humans and AI alike."

LeanSpec embraces:

- **Start with why**: What problem are you solving?
- **Capture the essentials**: What absolutely must be communicated?
- **Stay lean**: If it doesn't add clarity, cut it
- **Keep it living**: Update as you learn
