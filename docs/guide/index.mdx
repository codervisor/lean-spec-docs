# What is LeanSpec?

**Ship faster with higher quality. Lean specs that both humans and AI understand.**

LeanSpec brings agile principles to SDD (Spec-Driven Development)—small, focused documents (&lt;2,000 tokens) that keep you and your AI aligned.

> **Think of it as "Markdown for Project Management"**: Simple, structured, and machine-readable.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Try with a tutorial project
npx lean-spec init --example dark-theme
cd dark-theme && npm install && npm start

# Or add to your existing project
npm install -g lean-spec && lean-spec init
```

**Visualize your project:**

```bash
lean-spec board    # Kanban view
lean-spec stats    # Project metrics
lean-spec ui       # Web UI at localhost:3000
```

**Next:** [Your First Spec with AI](/docs/tutorials/first-spec-with-ai) (10 min tutorial)

## Why LeanSpec?

**High velocity + High quality.** Other SDD frameworks add process overhead (multi-step workflows, rigid templates). Vibe coding is fast but chaotic (no shared understanding). LeanSpec hits the sweet spot:

- **Fast iteration** - Living documents that grow with your code
- **AI performance** - Small specs = better AI output (context rot is real)
- **Always current** - Lightweight enough that you actually update them

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **📊 Kanban Board** | `lean-spec board` - visual project tracking |
| **🔍 Smart Search** | `lean-spec search` - find specs by content or metadata |
| **🔗 Dependencies** | Track spec relationships with `depends_on` and `related` |
| **🎨 Web UI** | `lean-spec ui` - browser-based dashboard |
| **📈 Project Stats** | `lean-spec stats` - health metrics and bottleneck detection |
| **🤖 AI-Native** | MCP server + CLI for AI assistants |

## AI Integration

Works with any AI coding assistant via MCP or CLI:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lean-spec": { "command": "npx", "args": ["@leanspec/mcp"] }
  }
}
```

**Compatible with:** VS Code Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more.

## What You Get

*   [**Core CLI**](/docs/guide/usage/cli/creating-managing): Manage specs, track status, and visualize dependencies.
*   [**MCP Server**](/docs/guide/usage/mcp-integration): Give AI agents direct access to read and search your specs.
*   [**Visual Mode**](/docs/guide/visual-mode): A beautiful web interface for browsing your project's spec graph.

## A Simple Example

A LeanSpec is just a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown title="./specs/001-user-auth-api/README.md"

status: in-progress
created: 2025-11-07
priority: high
tags: [api, auth]

# User Authentication API

## Goal
Enable secure user login and session management for the mobile app.

## Key Scenarios
1. User logs in with email/password → receives JWT token
2. User accesses protected endpoint with token → gets data
3. User token expires → receives 401, must re-authenticate

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login endpoint returns valid JWT on success
- [ ] JWT includes user ID and expiration
- [ ] Protected endpoints verify JWT signature

## Non-Goals
- Social login (future feature)
- Password reset (separate spec)
```
