# What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a lightweight **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology designed for the AI era. It helps teams—both humans and AI agents—focus on *intent* rather than implementation details.

> **Think of it as "Markdown for Project Management"**: Simple, structured, and machine-readable.

## Why LeanSpec?

Traditional specs are often too verbose (nobody reads them) or too vague (AI hallucinates). LeanSpec bridges this gap:

1.  **Context Economy**: Specs are kept small (&lt;2,000 tokens) to fit in AI context windows.
2.  **Living Documentation**: Specs evolve with the code, tracked by status (`planned` → `in-progress` → `complete`).
3.  **AI-Native**: Structured frontmatter and clear sections help AI agents understand *what* to build and *why*.

## What You Get

*   **Core CLI**: Manage specs, track status, and visualize dependencies (`lean-spec board`, `lean-spec deps`).
*   **MCP Server**: Give AI agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.) direct access to read and search your specs.
*   **Visual Mode**: A beautiful web interface for browsing your project's spec graph (`lean-spec ui`).
*   **Templates**: Built-in patterns for features, refactors, and experiments.

## A Simple Example

A LeanSpec is just a Markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
status: in-progress
created: 2025-11-07
priority: high
tags: [api, auth]
---

# User Authentication API

## Goal
Enable secure user login and session management for the mobile app.

## Key Scenarios
1. User logs in with email/password → receives JWT token
2. User accesses protected endpoint with token → gets data
3. User token expires → receives 401, must re-authenticate

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login endpoint returns valid JWT on success
- [ ] JWT includes user ID and expiration
- [ ] Protected endpoints verify JWT signature

## Non-Goals
- Social login (future feature)
- Password reset (separate spec)
```

## Next Steps

*   **[Getting Started](/docs/guide/getting-started)**: Install the CLI and create your first spec.
*   **[Understanding LeanSpec](/docs/guide/understanding-leanspec)**: Dive deeper into the "Context Economy" philosophy.
*   **[AI Integration](/docs/guide/usage/ai-assisted/mcp-integration)**: Connect LeanSpec to your AI coding assistant.
