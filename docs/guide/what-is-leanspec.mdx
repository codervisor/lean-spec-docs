# What Is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a lightweight methodology for writing specs that both humans and AI agents can act on. It focuses on capturing **intent**, **constraints**, and **success criteria** without drowning readers in ceremony.

## Why LeanSpec Exists

### Traditional Specs Fail New Constraints
- **Too long** → exceed human/AI working memory (violates Context Economy)
- **Too detailed** → rot fast and become untrustworthy
- **Too rigid** → block iteration when learnings emerge
- **Too vague** → AI cannot execute, humans keep asking follow-up questions

### AI-Powered Development Adds a Gap
Humans think in goals (“Make the dashboard fast”). AI agents need explicit guardrails (“Cache data in Redis, target &lt;100ms p95”). LeanSpec bridges that gap with structured-yet-readable docs.

## The LeanSpec Principles (Beginner Edition)
1. **Context Economy** — Keep each file under ~2,000 tokens so it fits in working memory.
2. **Signal-to-Noise** — Every sentence should inform a decision.
3. **Intent Over Implementation** — Capture why and what; let how emerge during execution.
4. **Bridge the Gap** — Write so humans and AI understand the same goal.
5. **Progressive Disclosure** — Start simple; add sub-specs or fields when pain appears.

You don’t have to memorize these on day one. Use them as a checklist when a spec feels bloated or unclear.

## What Problems Does LeanSpec Solve?
- **Lack of shared context** between humans and AI assistants
- **Lost decisions** when chats disappear
- **Overgrown documents** that nobody wants to maintain
- **Unclear ownership** because status and metadata live elsewhere

LeanSpec’s answer: keep specs short, purposeful, and structured. The CLI and MCP server then make them easy to search, validate, and hand off to AI agents.

## When to Write a Spec
Write or update a spec when:
- Intent needs clarification or multiple interpretations exist
- Trade-offs, constraints, or success criteria matter
- Work spans multiple files/systems or affects other teams
- AI agents will implement part of the feature
- Decisions should persist beyond a chat or meeting

## When to Skip It
Skip (or postpone) a spec when:
- Fixing an obvious bug with an obvious fix
- Performing mechanical refactors (rename, format, dependency bump)
- Prototyping to learn—capture the result if it graduates to real work

## LeanSpec + AI
- **Authoring**: Provide intent; let AI draft structure; you edit for clarity.
- **Implementation**: Give AI the spec so it can plan and modify code autonomously.
- **Memory**: Specs act as durable knowledge. Agents re-load them through the MCP server whenever they re-engage.
