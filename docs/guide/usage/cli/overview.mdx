# CLI Overview

The LeanSpec CLI provides a complete toolkit for managing specifications in your project. Whether you're a developer working directly or an AI agent automating workflows, the CLI offers efficient commands for every stage of the spec lifecycle.

## For Human Developers

The CLI gives you command-line control over your specs:

- **Create and manage** specs with simple commands
- **Search and discover** related work instantly
- **Track progress** with visual boards and metrics
- **Validate quality** to maintain spec health

Quick example workflow:
```bash
# Create new spec
lean-spec create auth-refactor --tags security

# Start working
lean-spec update 042 --status in-progress

# Check project health
lean-spec board

# Validate before committing
lean-spec validate
```

## For AI Agents

The CLI is designed as a **toolset for AI agents**, enabling them to:

- **Discover context** - Search and retrieve relevant specs to answer questions
- **Track decisions** - Access past architectural choices and rationale
- **Manage work** - Create, update, and link specs programmatically
- **Maintain quality** - Validate spec structure and token counts

AI agents can use LeanSpec CLI commands directly as tools:

```bash
# Agent searches for relevant context
lean-spec search "authentication decision"

# Agent retrieves specific spec
lean-spec view 042

# Agent checks dependencies
lean-spec deps 042

# Agent updates status after implementation
lean-spec update 042 --status complete
```

**MCP Server Integration**: For seamless AI agent access, LeanSpec provides an [MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](/docs/reference/mcp-server) that exposes CLI functionality as structured tools.

## Command Categories

The CLI organizes commands into logical groups:

### Creating & Managing
Core operations for spec lifecycle:
- `create` - Start new specs
- `update` - Modify status, priority, tags
- `view` - Read spec content
- `open` - Edit in your preferred editor

**Learn more**: [Creating & Managing Specs](/docs/guide/usage/cli/creating-managing)

### Finding Specs
Discover and navigate specifications:
- `list` - View all specs with filters
- `search` - Find by content or metadata
- `deps` - Explore relationships

**Learn more**: [Finding Specs](/docs/guide/usage/cli/finding-specs)

### Project Management
Track health and validate quality:
- `board` - Visual Kanban view
- `stats` - Project metrics
- `validate` - Check spec quality

**Learn more**: [Project Management](/docs/guide/usage/cli/project-management) and [Validation](/docs/guide/usage/cli/validation)

## Core Principles

The CLI design follows LeanSpec's [First Principles](/docs/advanced/first-principles):

1. **Context Economy** - Commands help manage token budgets (`tokens`, `validate`)
2. **Signal-to-Noise** - Quick access to relevant information (`search`, `deps`)
3. **Intent Over Implementation** - Focus on what and why, not just how
4. **Bridge the Gap** - Works for both humans and AI agents
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple by default, powerful when needed

## Quick Reference

**Most common commands:**

```bash
lean-spec create <name>           # Create new spec
lean-spec list                    # View all specs
lean-spec search "query"          # Find relevant specs
lean-spec view <spec>             # Read spec content
lean-spec update <spec> --status  # Update status
lean-spec board                   # Visual overview
lean-spec validate                # Check quality
```

**Get help anytime:**
```bash
lean-spec --help                  # All commands
lean-spec <command> --help        # Command details
```

## Integration Points

### Version Control
LeanSpec plays well with Git:
- Specs are plain markdown files
- All changes are traceable
- Easy to review in PRs

### CI/CD
Automate validation:
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- run: lean-spec validate
```

### Editors
Open specs in your preferred editor:
```bash
lean-spec open 042
```

### AI Tools
- **Direct CLI access** - Agents can call commands
- **MCP Server** - Structured tool interface
- **Search integration** - Semantic memory across sessions

## Best Practices

**For Humans:**
- Start your day with `lean-spec board`
- Use `lean-spec search` instead of grep
- Validate before committing
- Keep specs under 3,500 tokens

**For AI Agents:**
- Search before creating new specs
- Check dependencies before starting work
- Update status after implementation
- Use `lean-spec deps` for context

## Next Steps

**Remember**: The CLI is a tool for both human developers and AI agents. Whether you're typing commands or an AI is executing them, the goal is the same: maintain clear, actionable specifications that drive development forward.
