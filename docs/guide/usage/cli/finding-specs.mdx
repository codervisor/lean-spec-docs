# Finding Specs

Learn how to discover and navigate specs using search, list commands, and the MCP server for AI agent access.

## Quick Discovery

### List All Specs

```bash
# Show all specs
lean-spec list
```

Output:
```
📋 Spec List

🟡 ✅ 107-ui-ux-refinements #ui #ux #lessons-learned
🟡 ✅ 106-ui-package-documentation
🟡 ⏳ 105-docs-site-enhancements
🟠 ✅ 104-ui-packaging-fix #packaging #bug-fix
```

### Filter by Status

```bash
# Show only in-progress specs
lean-spec list --status in-progress

# Show planned specs
lean-spec list --status planned

# Show completed specs
lean-spec list --status complete
```

### Filter by Tag

```bash
# Show specs with specific tag
lean-spec list --tag api

# Show specs with multiple tags
lean-spec list --tag api --tag backend
```

### Filter by Priority

```bash
# High priority specs
lean-spec list --priority high

# Low priority specs
lean-spec list --priority low
```

## Search by Content

### Basic Search

```bash
# Search all spec content
lean-spec search "authentication"
```

Searches across:
- Spec titles and descriptions
- All README.md content
- Sub-spec files (DESIGN.md, TESTING.md, etc.)
- Frontmatter fields

### Search with Filters

```bash
# Search in specific status
lean-spec search "API" --status in-progress

# Search with tag filter
lean-spec search "cache" --tag performance

# Combine multiple filters
lean-spec search "refactor" --status planned --tag backend --priority high
```

### Case-Insensitive Search

Search is case-insensitive by default:
```bash
lean-spec search "api"      # Matches "API", "api", "Api"
lean-spec search "JWT"      # Matches "jwt", "JWT", "Jwt"
```

## Dependency Navigation

```bash
# Show dependencies for a spec
lean-spec deps 042
```

Output:
```
Dependency Graph for 042-auth-refactor

Depends On:
  → 041-jwt-library [complete]       # Required to start

Required By:
  ← 043-api-redesign [planned]       # Blocked until 042 done
  ← 044-dashboard [planned]

Related Specs:
  ⟷ 045-security-audit [in-progress]  # Coordinated work
```

Navigate relationships:
- **Depends On (→)**: What this spec requires before it can start
- **Required By (←)**: What's blocked waiting for this
- **Related (⟷)**: Informational connections

**See also**: [Dependencies](/docs/guide/usage/cli/project-management#dependencies)

## Advanced Filtering

### Combine Multiple Criteria

```bash
# High-priority backend work that's planned
lean-spec list --priority high --tag backend --status planned

# In-progress API work
lean-spec list --status in-progress --tag api

# Completed security work
lean-spec list --status complete --tag security
```

### Exclude Archived

By default, archived specs are excluded from `lean-spec list`:

```bash
# Default: excludes archived
lean-spec list

# Include archived
lean-spec list --archived
```

## Common Search Patterns

### Find Work to Start

```bash
# What's ready to work on?
lean-spec list --status planned --priority high
```

### Check Active Work

```bash
# What's in progress?
lean-spec list --status in-progress

# Who's working on what?
lean-spec list --status in-progress
# (shows assignee if set)
```

### Review Completed Work

```bash
# Recently completed
lean-spec list --status complete

# Completed work by tag
lean-spec list --status complete --tag api
```

### Check Dependencies

```bash
# What's ready to start?
lean-spec list --status planned

# Check if dependencies are met
lean-spec deps <spec-id>
# (verify required specs are complete)
```

## Navigation Tips

**DO:**
- ✅ Use `lean-spec search` for content-based discovery
- ✅ Use `lean-spec list` with filters for focused views
- ✅ Use `lean-spec deps` to understand relationships
- ✅ Check [Board & Stats](/docs/guide/usage/cli/project-management#board-stats) for visual overview

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Manually grep through specs/ directory
- ❌ Rely on filesystem naming (use IDs/search instead)
- ❌ Forget archived specs exist (use --archived to include them)

## Keyboard-Driven Workflows

### Quick Discovery Flow

```bash
# 1. What's the project state?
lean-spec list --status in-progress

# 2. What should I work on?
lean-spec list --status planned --priority high

# 3. What's this spec about?
lean-spec view <spec-id>

# 4. Start working
lean-spec update <spec-id> --status in-progress
lean-spec open <spec-id>
```

### Research Flow

```bash
# 1. Find relevant specs
lean-spec search "authentication"

# 2. View promising spec
lean-spec view 042

# 3. Check related work
lean-spec deps 042

# 4. Read related spec
lean-spec view 041
```
