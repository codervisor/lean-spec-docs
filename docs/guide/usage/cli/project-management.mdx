# Project Management

Track project health, manage dependencies, and validate spec quality with LeanSpec's project management features.

## Board & Stats {#board-stats}

Get instant visibility into your project's health with board and stats commands.

### Board Command

Visual kanban view of your specs:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

Shows specs organized by status columns:
- 📅 **Planned** - Specs ready to start
- ⏳ **In Progress** - Active work
- ✅ **Complete** - Finished specs

#### Project Overview

The board includes a project overview box:
- Total specs count
- Active vs Complete count
- Completion percentage
- Velocity metrics (cycle time, throughput)

#### Filtering

Filter the board view:

```bash
# Show only high priority specs
lean-spec board --priority high

# Show specs with specific tag
lean-spec board --tag feature

# Combine filters
lean-spec board --priority high --tag api
```

### Stats Command

Quick project metrics:

```bash
lean-spec stats
```

Shows:
- **Overview**: Total specs, active count, completion rate
- **Status**: Visual bar chart of status distribution
- **Priority Focus**: Breakdown by priority
- **Needs Attention**: Critical/High priority specs not started
- **Velocity Summary**: Cycle time and throughput

#### Full Analytics

Get detailed analytics:

```bash
lean-spec stats --full
```

Provides comprehensive project insights:
- Detailed status metrics
- Priority breakdown
- Tag frequency analysis
- Completion trends
- Average time in each status
- Health indicators

### Common Workflows

**Daily Standup:**
```bash
# Quick project overview
lean-spec board

# See what's in progress
lean-spec board --status in-progress

# Check high priority items
lean-spec board --priority high
```

**Sprint Planning:**
```bash
# Review project health
lean-spec stats --full

# See what's ready to start
lean-spec board --status planned

# Check capacity
lean-spec stats
```

**Weekly Review:**
```bash
# Overall project metrics
lean-spec stats --full

# Review completed work
lean-spec board --status complete

# Identify bottlenecks
lean-spec board --status in-progress
```

### Project Health Indicators

The board and stats commands help identify:

**⚠️ Warning Signs:**
- Too many in-progress specs (focus issues)
- Old specs without updates (stale work)
- High percentage of planned specs (execution gap)
- Specs with unmet dependencies (check with `lean-spec deps`)

**✅ Healthy Signals:**
- Steady completion rate
- Balanced status distribution
- Active recent updates
- Clear priority focus

## Dependencies {#dependencies}

Manage relationships between specs with dependency tracking.

### Relationship Types

LeanSpec has two types of relationships:

#### `related` - Bidirectional Soft Reference
- **Meaning**: Informational relationship (specs are connected/related)
- **Behavior**: Automatically shown from both sides
- **Symbol**: ⟷ (bidirectional arrow)

#### `depends_on` - Directional Blocking Dependency
- **Meaning**: Hard dependency - spec cannot start until dependencies complete
- **Behavior**: Directional only (shows differently from each side)
- **Symbol**: → (depends on) and ← (blocks)

### Related Specs

Use `related` for informational connections:

```bash
# Link spec 042 to 043 and 044
lean-spec link 042 --related 043,044
```

Both sides see the relationship:

```bash
$ lean-spec deps 042
Related Specs:
  ⟷ 043-feature-launch [in-progress]
  ⟷ 044-api-update [planned]

$ lean-spec deps 043
Related Specs:
  ⟷ 042-error-handling [complete]  # Automatically shown!
```

**Use when:**
- Specs cover related topics or features
- Work is coordinated but not blocking
- Context is helpful but not required

### Blocking Dependencies

Use `depends_on` for hard dependencies:

```bash
# Spec A depends on Spec B
lean-spec link spec-a --depends-on spec-b
```

Shows differently from each side:

```bash
$ lean-spec deps spec-a
Depends On:
  → spec-b [in-progress]  # A depends on B

$ lean-spec deps spec-b
Required By:
  ← spec-a [planned]  # B is required by A
```

**Use when:**
- Spec truly cannot start until another completes
- There's a clear dependency chain
- Work must be done in specific order

### Deps Command

View all relationships for a spec:

```bash
lean-spec deps <spec>
```

Shows:
- Specs this depends on (→)
- Specs that depend on this (←)
- Related specs (⟷)

**Example Output:**

```
Dependency Graph for 043-feature-launch

Depends On:
  → 042-error-handling [complete] ✅
  → 041-api-design [complete] ✅

Required By:
  ← 044-integration-test [planned]
  ← 045-documentation [planned]

Related Specs:
  ⟷ 040-performance [in-progress]
  ⟷ 039-security-audit [complete]
```

### Best Practices

**1. Use `related` by Default**

Most relationships are informational, not blocking:

```bash
# ✅ Good - Related specs for context
lean-spec link feature-a --related feature-b

# ❌ Overuse - Not a true blocking dependency
lean-spec link feature-a --depends-on documentation-spec
```

**2. Reserve `depends_on` for True Blockers**

Only use when work truly cannot start:

```bash
# ✅ Good - API must exist before integration
lean-spec link integration --depends-on api-implementation

# ❌ Bad - These can be done in parallel
lean-spec link feature --depends-on docs-update
```

**3. Avoid Circular Dependencies**

```bash
# ❌ Bad - Circular dependency
lean-spec link spec-a --depends-on spec-b
lean-spec link spec-b --depends-on spec-a
```

LeanSpec will warn about circular dependencies.

**4. Update Once, Show Everywhere**

`related` only needs to be linked from one side:

```bash
# ✅ Good - Link from A to B
lean-spec link spec-a --related spec-b

# Spec B automatically shows relationship to A
```

### Dependency Workflows

**Before Starting Work:**

Check dependencies:

```bash
lean-spec deps <spec>
```

Ensure all `depends_on` specs are complete before starting.

**During Planning:**

Map relationships:

```bash
# View related work
lean-spec deps feature-spec

# Check what's blocked
lean-spec board --status planned
```

**Identifying Bottlenecks:**

Find specs blocking others:

```bash
# Check what depends on this
lean-spec deps <in-progress-spec>

# Look for "Required By" items
```

### Dependency Patterns

**Sequential Work:**

```bash
# Phase 2 depends on Phase 1
lean-spec link phase-2 --depends-on phase-1

# Phase 3 depends on Phase 2
lean-spec link phase-3 --depends-on phase-2
```

**Parallel Work with Coordination:**

```bash
# Link all related features
lean-spec link feature-a --related feature-b,feature-c
lean-spec link feature-b --related feature-c
```

**Integration Point:**

```bash
# Tests blocked until feature done
lean-spec link tests --depends-on core-feature

# Docs related but not blocked
lean-spec link docs --related core-feature
```

### Managing Changes

**Adding Dependencies:**

```bash
# Add dependency
lean-spec link my-spec --depends-on prerequisite-spec
```

**Removing Dependencies:**

When a dependency is no longer needed:

```bash
# Remove dependency
lean-spec unlink my-spec --depends-on old-requirement

# Replace with related (optional)
lean-spec link my-spec --related old-requirement
```

## Validation {#validation}

Ensure spec quality with LeanSpec's built-in validation.

### Validate Command

Check specs for quality issues:

```bash
lean-spec validate
```

Validates all specs by default. Check specific specs:

```bash
lean-spec validate <spec-1> <spec-2>
```

### Quality Checks

#### Token Count Analysis

Based on **Context Economy** principle - specs must fit in AI working memory:

- **✅ Excellent**: \<2,000 tokens - 100% AI effectiveness
- **👍 Good**: 2,000-3,500 tokens - 95% AI effectiveness
- **⚠️ Warning**: 3,500-5,000 tokens - 85% AI effectiveness
- **🔴 Error**: >5,000 tokens - 70% AI effectiveness, should split

**Rationale**: 
- AI context windows: Limited and expensive
- Quality degradation starts before 50K token hard limits
- Human + AI working memory: ~2-3K tokens for optimal comprehension
- Physics + Biology + Economics = Hard limit

**Line Count Backstop**:
LeanSpec also checks line counts as a safety net (400 warning / 500 max), but **token count is the primary metric** since it directly measures AI working memory consumption.

#### Sub-Spec Validation

Checks sub-spec files (DESIGN.md, TESTING.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, etc.):

- Each sub-spec also follows token limits
- Total spec size (main + sub-specs) tracked
- Recommends splitting if any file exceeds threshold

#### Frontmatter Validation

Ensures required fields are present and valid:

**Required Fields:**
- `status`: Must be valid (planned, in-progress, complete, etc.)
- `priority`: Must be valid (high, medium, low, none)
- `created`: Valid date format

**Optional Fields (validated if present):**
- `tags`: Proper format
- `depends_on`, `related`: Valid spec references
- Custom fields: Proper types

#### Structure Validation

Checks spec organization:

- README.md exists (main spec file)
- Sub-specs follow naming conventions
- No orphaned or duplicate content

### Validation Output

**Clean Validation:**

```bash
$ lean-spec validate

✅ All specs valid!

Summary:
  • 45 specs checked
  • 0 errors
  • 0 warnings
```

**With Warnings:**

```bash
$ lean-spec validate

⚠️  Warnings found:

058-docs-overview-polish/README.md
  ⚠️  Token count: 4,200 tokens (85% AI effectiveness)
  → Consider: Simplifying or splitting into sub-specs

Summary:
  • 45 specs checked
  • 0 errors
  • 1 warning
```

**With Errors:**

```bash
$ lean-spec validate

❌ Errors found:

042-complex-spec/README.md
  🔴 Token count: 5,800 tokens (70% AI effectiveness)
  → Action: Split into sub-specs to improve AI comprehension

043-broken-spec/README.md
  🔴 Invalid status: 'in_progress' (should be 'in-progress')
  🔴 Missing required field: 'created'

Summary:
  • 45 specs checked
  • 3 errors
  • 0 warnings
```

### Custom Validation Options

**Set Custom Thresholds:**

```bash
# Stricter token threshold
lean-spec validate --warning-threshold 4000

# More lenient threshold
lean-spec validate --warning-threshold 6000

# Custom line count backstop
lean-spec validate --max-lines 500
```

**Validate Specific Aspects:**

```bash
# Only check complexity (tokens)
lean-spec validate --check complexity

# Only check frontmatter
lean-spec validate --check frontmatter

# Only check structure
lean-spec validate --check structure
```

### Fixing Validation Issues

**Token Count Violations:**

**Problem**: Spec exceeds 5,000 tokens (70% AI effectiveness)

**Solution**: Split using sub-specs

```markdown
# Before: Single 5,800-token spec
README.md (5,800 tokens) 🔴 - 70% AI effectiveness

# After: Split into focused sub-specs
README.md (2,000 tokens) ✅ - Overview, decision, summary (100% effectiveness)
DESIGN.md (1,500 tokens) ✅ - Detailed design (100% effectiveness)
IMPLEMENTATION.md (1,500 tokens) ✅ - Implementation plan (100% effectiveness)
```

**Why this works**:
- Each file stays under 2,000 tokens for optimal AI comprehension
- AI can focus on one aspect at a time
- Humans can navigate to relevant sections quickly

**Invalid Frontmatter:**

**Problem**: Invalid or missing frontmatter fields

**Solution**: Use `lean-spec update` to fix:

```bash
# Fix status
lean-spec update <spec> --status in-progress

# Fix priority
lean-spec update <spec> --priority high

# Fix tags
lean-spec update <spec> --tags feature,api
```

**Structure Issues:**

**Problem**: Missing README.md or malformed sub-specs

**Solution**: 
- Ensure README.md exists as main spec file
- Follow sub-spec naming: DESIGN.md, TESTING.md, etc.
- Use proper frontmatter in all files

### Validation Workflows

**Pre-Commit Check:**

Run before committing:

```bash
lean-spec validate
```

Fix any errors before committing changes.

**CI/CD Integration:**

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate.yml
name: Validate Specs

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install -g lean-spec
      - run: lean-spec validate
```

**Regular Review:**

Weekly spec health check:

```bash
# Check overall health
lean-spec validate

# Detailed analysis
lean-spec stats --full

# Review large specs (token focus)
lean-spec tokens --all --include-sub-specs
```

### When to Split

Split when:
- ✅ Spec exceeds ~3,500 tokens (Context Economy warning)
- ✅ Multiple distinct concerns (different topics)
- ✅ Spec takes >10 minutes to read
- ✅ Frequent editing causes confusion

Don't split when:
- ❌ Under ~2,000 tokens and focused
- ❌ Single cohesive concept
- ❌ Quick to read and understand

### When to Simplify

Simplify when:
- Excessive detail for simple feature
- Repeated information
- Low signal-to-noise ratio
- Future speculation

### When to Accept Warnings

Sometimes warnings are acceptable:
- Temporarily high during active development
- Complex feature needing comprehensive detail
- Splitting would reduce clarity

Always re-evaluate later.

## Best Practices

### Board & Stats

1. **Check daily** - Start your day with `lean-spec board`
2. **Review weekly** - Use `lean-spec stats --full` for trends
3. **Limit WIP** - Keep in-progress specs under control
4. **Update regularly** - Keep status current with `lean-spec update`
5. **Use priorities** - Focus on high-priority work first

### Dependencies

1. **Use `related` by default** - Most relationships aren't blocking
2. **Reserve `depends_on`** - Only for true blockers
3. **Check before starting** - Ensure dependencies are met
4. **Avoid circular deps** - Keep dependency chains simple
5. **Use CLI commands** - `lean-spec link`/`unlink`, not manual edits

### Validation

1. **Validate early** - Before committing
2. **Fix warnings promptly** - Don't let them accumulate
3. **Split around 3,500 tokens** - Use sub-specs for complex features
4. **Automate** - Add to CI/CD pipeline
5. **Regular reviews** - Weekly health checks
