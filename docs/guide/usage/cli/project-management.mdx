# Project Management

Track project health, manage dependencies, and validate spec quality with LeanSpec's project management features.

## Board & Stats {#board-stats}

Get instant visibility into your project's health with board and stats commands.

### Board Command

Visual kanban view of your specs:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

Shows specs organized by status columns:
- 📅 **Planned** - Specs ready to start
- ⏳ **In Progress** - Active work
- ✅ **Complete** - Finished specs

#### Project Overview

The board includes a project overview box:
- Total specs count
- Active vs Complete count
- Completion percentage
- Velocity metrics (cycle time, throughput)

#### Filtering

Filter the board view:

```bash
# Show only high priority specs
lean-spec board --priority high

# Show specs with specific tag
lean-spec board --tag feature

# Combine filters
lean-spec board --priority high --tag api
```

### Stats Command

Quick project metrics:

```bash
lean-spec stats
```

Shows:
- **Overview**: Total specs, active count, completion rate
- **Status**: Visual bar chart of status distribution
- **Priority Focus**: Breakdown by priority
- **Needs Attention**: Critical/High priority specs not started
- **Velocity Summary**: Cycle time and throughput

#### Full Analytics

Get detailed analytics:

```bash
lean-spec stats --full
```

Provides comprehensive project insights:
- Detailed status metrics
- Priority breakdown
- Tag frequency analysis
- Completion trends
- Average time in each status
- Health indicators

### Common Workflows

**Daily Standup:**
```bash
# Quick project overview
lean-spec board

# See what's in progress
lean-spec board --status in-progress

# Check high priority items
lean-spec board --priority high
```

**Sprint Planning:**
```bash
# Review project health
lean-spec stats --full

# See what's ready to start
lean-spec board --status planned

# Check capacity
lean-spec stats
```

**Weekly Review:**
```bash
# Overall project metrics
lean-spec stats --full

# Review completed work
lean-spec board --status complete

# Identify bottlenecks
lean-spec board --status in-progress
```

### Project Health Indicators

The board and stats commands help identify:

**⚠️ Warning Signs:**
- Too many in-progress specs (focus issues)
- Old specs without updates (stale work)
- High percentage of planned specs (execution gap)
- Specs with unmet dependencies (check with `lean-spec deps`)

**✅ Healthy Signals:**
- Steady completion rate
- Balanced status distribution
- Active recent updates
- Clear priority focus

## Dependencies {#dependencies}

Manage relationships between specs with dependency tracking.

### Relationship Types

LeanSpec has two types of relationships:

#### `related` - Bidirectional Soft Reference
- **Meaning**: Informational relationship (specs are connected/related)
- **Behavior**: Automatically shown from both sides
- **Symbol**: ⟷ (bidirectional arrow)

#### `depends_on` - Directional Blocking Dependency
- **Meaning**: Hard dependency - spec cannot start until dependencies complete
- **Behavior**: Directional only (shows differently from each side)
- **Symbol**: → (depends on) and ← (blocks)

### Related Specs

Use `related` for informational connections:

```bash
# Link spec 042 to 043 and 044
lean-spec link 042 --related 043,044
```

Both sides see the relationship:

```bash
$ lean-spec deps 042
Related Specs:
  ⟷ 043-feature-launch [in-progress]
  ⟷ 044-api-update [planned]

$ lean-spec deps 043
Related Specs:
  ⟷ 042-error-handling [complete]  # Automatically shown!
```

**Use when:**
- Specs cover related topics or features
- Work is coordinated but not blocking
- Context is helpful but not required

### Blocking Dependencies

Use `depends_on` for hard dependencies:

```bash
# Spec A depends on Spec B
lean-spec link spec-a --depends-on spec-b
```

Shows differently from each side:

```bash
$ lean-spec deps spec-a
Depends On:
  → spec-b [in-progress]  # A depends on B

$ lean-spec deps spec-b
Required By:
  ← spec-a [planned]  # B is required by A
```

**Use when:**
- Spec truly cannot start until another completes
- There's a clear dependency chain
- Work must be done in specific order

### Deps Command

View all relationships for a spec:

```bash
lean-spec deps <spec>
```

Shows:
- Specs this depends on (→)
- Specs that depend on this (←)
- Related specs (⟷)

**Example Output:**

```
Dependency Graph for 043-feature-launch

Depends On:
  → 042-error-handling [complete] ✅
  → 041-api-design [complete] ✅

Required By:
  ← 044-integration-test [planned]
  ← 045-documentation [planned]

Related Specs:
  ⟷ 040-performance [in-progress]
  ⟷ 039-security-audit [complete]
```

### Best Practices

**1. Use `related` by Default**

Most relationships are informational, not blocking:

```bash
# ✅ Good - Related specs for context
lean-spec link feature-a --related feature-b

# ❌ Overuse - Not a true blocking dependency
lean-spec link feature-a --depends-on documentation-spec
```

**2. Reserve `depends_on` for True Blockers**

Only use when work truly cannot start:

```bash
# ✅ Good - API must exist before integration
lean-spec link integration --depends-on api-implementation

# ❌ Bad - These can be done in parallel
lean-spec link feature --depends-on docs-update
```

**3. Avoid Circular Dependencies**

```bash
# ❌ Bad - Circular dependency
lean-spec link spec-a --depends-on spec-b
lean-spec link spec-b --depends-on spec-a
```

LeanSpec will warn about circular dependencies.

**4. Update Once, Show Everywhere**

`related` only needs to be linked from one side:

```bash
# ✅ Good - Link from A to B
lean-spec link spec-a --related spec-b

# Spec B automatically shows relationship to A
```

### Dependency Workflows

**Before Starting Work:**

Check dependencies:

```bash
lean-spec deps <spec>
```

Ensure all `depends_on` specs are complete before starting.

**During Planning:**

Map relationships:

```bash
# View related work
lean-spec deps feature-spec

# Check what's blocked
lean-spec board --status planned
```

**Identifying Bottlenecks:**

Find specs blocking others:

```bash
# Check what depends on this
lean-spec deps <in-progress-spec>

# Look for "Required By" items
```

### Dependency Patterns

**Sequential Work:**

```bash
# Phase 2 depends on Phase 1
lean-spec link phase-2 --depends-on phase-1

# Phase 3 depends on Phase 2
lean-spec link phase-3 --depends-on phase-2
```

**Parallel Work with Coordination:**

```bash
# Link all related features
lean-spec link feature-a --related feature-b,feature-c
lean-spec link feature-b --related feature-c
```

**Integration Point:**

```bash
# Tests blocked until feature done
lean-spec link tests --depends-on core-feature

# Docs related but not blocked
lean-spec link docs --related core-feature
```

### Managing Changes

**Adding Dependencies:**

```bash
# Add dependency
lean-spec link my-spec --depends-on prerequisite-spec
```

**Removing Dependencies:**

When a dependency is no longer needed:

```bash
# Remove dependency
lean-spec unlink my-spec --depends-on old-requirement

# Replace with related (optional)
lean-spec link my-spec --related old-requirement
```

## Best Practices

### Board & Stats

1. **Check daily** - Start your day with `lean-spec board`
2. **Review weekly** - Use `lean-spec stats --full` for trends
3. **Limit WIP** - Keep in-progress specs under control
4. **Update regularly** - Keep status current with `lean-spec update`
5. **Use priorities** - Focus on high-priority work first

### Dependencies

1. **Use `related` by default** - Most relationships aren't blocking
2. **Reserve `depends_on`** - Only for true blockers
3. **Check before starting** - Ensure dependencies are met
4. **Avoid circular deps** - Keep dependency chains simple
5. **Use CLI commands** - `lean-spec link`/`unlink`, not manual edits
