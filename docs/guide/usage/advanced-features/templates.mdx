# Templates

LeanSpec provides customizable templates to match your workflow and team structure.

## Overview

Templates are complete working models that include:
- Spec structure and examples
- `AGENTS.md` for AI agent integration
- Supporting files (CONTRIBUTING.md, checklists, etc.)
- Project-specific configuration

## Available Templates

**Best for:** Quick prototypes, personal projects, when you want absolute simplicity

**Includes:**
- Minimal frontmatter (status, created only)
- Lightweight structure
- No AGENTS.md or extra files
- Focus on speed

**Example frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
status: planned
created: 2025-11-02
---
```

**Sections:**
- Goal
- Key Points
- Non-Goals
- Notes

### Standard

Recommended for most projects - includes AGENTS.md and solid structure.

**Best for:** Solo developers, small teams (2-5 people), most projects

**Includes:**
- Status, tags, priority fields
- AGENTS.md for AI integration

- Sub-spec guidance for complex features

**Example frontmatter:**

## Custom Templates

You can create your own templates in `.lean-spec/templates/`.

### Creating a Custom Template

1. Create template file:
```bash
mkdir -p .lean-spec/templates
touch .lean-spec/templates/my-template.md
```

2. Edit template with placeholders:
```markdown
---
status: planned
created: {date}
---

# {name}

**Team**: {team}
**Author**: {author}

## Overview

[Your custom sections...]
```

3. Configure in `.lean-spec/config.json`:
```json
{
  "template": "my-template.md"
}
```

### Available Variables

- `{name}` - Spec name
- `{date}` - Creation date (ISO format)
- `{project_name}` - From package.json
- `{author}` - From git config user.name
- `{git_user}` - Git username
- `{git_email}` - Git email
- `{git_repo}` - Repository name

Add custom variables in config:
```json
{
  "variables": {
    "team": "Platform Engineering",
    "company": "Acme Corp"
  }
}
```

## Template Structure

A complete template includes:

### 1. Frontmatter
```yaml
---
status: planned
created: {date}
tags: []
priority: medium
---
```

### 2. Visual Badges
```markdown
> **Status**: 📅 Planned · **Created**: {date}
```

### 3. Content Sections
```markdown
## Overview
## Goal
## Key Scenarios
## Acceptance Criteria
## Technical Approach
## Non-Goals
```

Customize sections to fit your needs.

## Switching Templates

To change templates mid-project:

1. Update `.lean-spec/config.json`:
```json
{
  "template": "new-template.md"
}
```

2. New specs will use the new template

3. Existing specs remain unchanged (update manually if needed)

## Best Practices

:::tip Start Simple
Begin with minimal or standard template. Add complexity only when you feel the pain of not having it.
:::

:::tip Iterate on Templates
Refine your templates based on what actually gets used. Remove unused sections.
:::

:::tip Keep Sections Optional
Not every spec needs every section. Use what adds value, skip what doesn't.
:::

:::tip Share Templates
Export your `.lean-spec/templates/` directory to share with other teams or projects.
