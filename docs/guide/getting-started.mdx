# Getting Started

This guide will help you install LeanSpec and set up your first project.

## Installation

LeanSpec can be installed globally or as a project dependency.

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
```

This makes the `lean-spec` command available system-wide.

### Project Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -D lean-spec

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -D lean-spec

# Using yarn
yarn add -D lean-spec
```

For project installation, you'll need to use `npx lean-spec` or add scripts to your `package.json`.

## Verify Installation

Check that LeanSpec is installed correctly:

```bash
lean-spec --version
```

You should see the version number (e.g., `0.1.0`).

## Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
lean-spec init
```

This interactive command will guide you through three setup paths:

### 1. Quick Start (Recommended for Solo Developers)

Zero configuration using standard template. Gets you up and running in seconds.

```bash
? How would you like to set up?
  ❯ Quick start (recommended)
    Choose a template
    Customize everything
```

This creates:
- `.lean-spec/config.json` with minimal configuration
- `specs/` directory for your specs
- `AGENTS.md` with AI agent integration guidance (if not present)

### 2. Choose a Template

Select from pre-configured templates for different team sizes and workflows:

- **minimal**: Just folder structure, no extras
- **standard**: Recommended - includes AGENTS.md and examples (default)
- **enterprise**: Governance with approvals and compliance

Each template includes:
- Spec structure and examples
- AGENTS.md for AI agent integration
- Supporting files (CONTRIBUTING.md, checklists, etc.)
- Project-specific configuration

### 3. Customize Everything

Full control over configuration (coming soon).

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── .lean-spec/
│   ├── config.json         # LeanSpec configuration
│   └── templates/          # Custom spec templates (optional)
│       └── spec-template.md
├── specs/                  # All your specs live here
│   ├── 001-first-feature/  # Flat structure with global numbering
│   ├── 002-second-feature/
│   └── archived/           # Completed specs
├── AGENTS.md              # AI agent integration guidance
└── ... (your project files)
```

**Note**: Default structure is flat with global numbering (`001-name/`, `002-name/`). For date-based grouping, configure the `structure.pattern` in `.lean-spec/config.json`.

## Integrating with Existing Projects

If you already have `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, or other system prompts, `lean-spec init` will detect them and offer three options:

1. **Merge** - Appends LeanSpec guidance to your existing `AGENTS.md` (preserves your content)
2. **Backup** - Saves existing files as `.backup` and creates fresh ones
3. **Skip** - Only adds `.lean-spec` config and `specs/` directory, keeps your files untouched

This makes it easy to adopt LeanSpec incrementally without disrupting your existing AI agent setup.

## Configuration

The `.lean-spec/config.json` file controls LeanSpec behavior:

```json
{
  "template": "spec-template.md",
  "specsDir": "specs",
  "structure": {
    "pattern": "flat",
    "prefix": "",
    "dateFormat": "YYYYMMDD",
    "sequenceDigits": 3,
    "defaultFile": "README.md"
  },
  "frontmatter": {
    "required": ["status", "created"],
    "optional": ["tags", "priority", "assignee", "reviewer"],
    "custom": {}
  },
  "variables": {}
}
```

You can customize this to fit your workflow. See [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/config) for details.

## Create Your First Spec

Now you're ready to create your first spec:

```bash
lean-spec create my-feature
```

This creates:
- `specs/001-my-feature/` folder (flat structure with global numbering)
- `README.md` inside with your template content
- Frontmatter with default metadata

Edit the `README.md` file to document your feature.

## Basic Commands

Here are the essential commands to get you started:

```bash
# Create a spec
lean-spec create feature-name

# List all specs
lean-spec list

# View a spec
lean-spec view 001

# Update spec metadata (by number or path)
lean-spec update 001 --status=in-progress
lean-spec update specs/001-my-feature --status=in-progress

# Archive completed specs
lean-spec archive 001
```

For a complete command reference, see [CLI Commands](/docs/reference/cli).

## Visual Mode (Optional)

LeanSpec includes a web UI for visual spec management. This is great for browsing specs, visualizing dependencies, and presentations.

```bash
# Start the web UI
lean-spec ui

# Or use without installing the CLI
npx @leanspec/ui
```

The UI provides:
- **Interactive Browser**: List and search all specs with rich formatting
- **Dependency Graphs**: Visualize relationships between specs
- **Board View**: Kanban-style view organized by status
- **Project Stats**: Overview of your specs and progress

The UI runs locally on port 3000 and automatically opens in your browser. Your specs are read directly from the filesystem with no setup required.

**Learn more**: [Visual Mode Guide](/docs/guide/visual-mode) for detailed features and usage.

## AI Integration (Optional)

LeanSpec works great with AI coding agents. When you ran `lean-spec init`, it created `AGENTS.md` with instructions for AI agents.

### Quick AI Setup

**For AI to access specs through MCP (recommended):**

1. Install LeanSpec globally (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g lean-spec
   ```

2. Configure your AI tool:

   **VS Code (GitHub Copilot)** - Add to settings.json:
   ```json
   {
     "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
       "lean-spec": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "lean-spec", "mcp"],
         "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Claude Desktop** - Add to claude_desktop_config.json:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "lean-spec": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "lean-spec", "mcp"],
         "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/your/project"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Test it:
   ```
   Ask your AI: "List all specs in this project"
   ```

**Without MCP (basic):**
- AI can still read specs from files
- Reference AGENTS.md in your prompts: "Follow instructions in AGENTS.md"
- Manually point AI to spec files when needed

**Learn more**: [MCP Integration](/docs/guide/usage/ai-assisted/mcp-integration) for detailed setup and benefits.
