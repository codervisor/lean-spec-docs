# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up LeanSpec and adopt the SDD workflow for your project. It takes about 5 minutes.

:::warning Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **AI Coding Tool**: Set up your preferred tool (e.g., [VS Code GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), etc.)
:::

## Installation

Install LeanSpec globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
```

This makes the `lean-spec` command available system-wide.

## Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
lean-spec init -y
```

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── .lean-spec/        # LeanSpec configuration
├── specs/             # All your specs live here
├── AGENTS.md          # System prompts for AI agents
└── ... (your project files)
```

## Create Your First Spec

In your AI tool, prompt:

```
Create a new spec for the feature "my-feature" following these requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- ...
```

Or simply:

```
Create a new spec for "my-feature".
```

The AI will use the CLI or MCP (if configured) to create and populate the spec.

This creates:
- `specs/001-my-feature/` folder (flat structure with sequential numbering)
- `README.md` with template content and frontmatter metadata
- **Spec details filled out by AI** (no manual editing needed)

The spec content looks like this:

```markdown title="specs/001-my-feature/README.md"
---
status: planned
created: '2025-11-02'
priority: medium
---

# My Feature

> **Status**: 📅 Planned · **Priority**: Medium · **Created**: 2025-11-02

(... spec details filled out by AI ...)
```

## Implement the Spec

Once the spec is created, review it and implement the feature according to the spec details.

In your AI tool, ask:

```
Implement the feature "my-feature".
```

Or simply:

```
Implement spec 1.
```

The AI will read the spec and start implementing based on the requirements.

In a typical agentic workflow, the AI will:
1. Read the spec details
2. Analyze the codebase
3. Generate code changes to implement the feature
4. Summarize changes and document progress in the spec

:::tip Recommended AI Models
While not required, we strongly recommend using advanced LLMs like [Claude Sonnet 4.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5), [GPT-5.1](https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1/), or [Gemini 3](https://aistudio.google.com/models/gemini-3) for the best results with LeanSpec.

## After Implementation

Once the AI completes implementation, you can:
- **Review**: Review the progress (reported by AI) and test the feature
- **Continue**: If incomplete, start a new chat session and ask the AI to continue
- **Feedback**: If unsatisfied with the implementation, provide feedback to the AI for improvements
