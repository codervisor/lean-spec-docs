# Getting Started

This guide will help you install LeanSpec and set up your first project.

## Pre-requisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 20 or higher) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **AI Tool**: If you plan to integrate with AI coding agents (like GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.), make sure you have your preferred tool set up.

## Installation

LeanSpec can be installed globally using npm.

```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
```

This makes the `lean-spec` command available system-wide.

## Verify Installation

Check that LeanSpec is installed correctly:

```bash
lean-spec --version
```

You should see the version number (e.g., `0.3.0`).

## Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
lean-spec init
```

This interactive command will guide you through three setup paths:

### 1. Quick Start (Recommended for Solo Developers)

Zero configuration using standard template. Gets you up and running in seconds.

```bash
? How would you like to set up?
  ❯ Quick start (recommended)
    Choose a template
```

This creates:
- `.lean-spec/config.json` with minimal configuration
- `specs/` directory for your specs
- `AGENTS.md` with AI agent integration guidance (if not present)

### 2. Choose a Template

Select from pre-configured templates for different team sizes and workflows:

- **minimal**: Just folder structure, no extras
- **standard**: Recommended - includes AGENTS.md and examples (default)
- **enterprise**: Governance with approvals and compliance

Each template includes:
- Spec structure and examples
- AGENTS.md for AI agent integration
- Supporting files (CONTRIBUTING.md, checklists, etc.)
- Project-specific configuration

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── .lean-spec/
│   ├── config.json         # LeanSpec configuration
│   └── templates/          # Custom spec templates (optional)
│       └── spec-template.md
├── specs/                  # All your specs live here
│   ├── 001-first-feature/  # Flat structure with global numbering
│   ├── 002-second-feature/
│   └── archived/           # Completed specs
├── AGENTS.md              # AI agent integration guidance
└── ... (your project files)
```

## Configuration

The `.lean-spec/config.json` file controls LeanSpec behavior:

```json title=".lean-spec/config.json"
{
  "template": "spec-template.md",
  "specsDir": "specs",
  "structure": {
    "pattern": "flat",
    "prefix": "",
    "dateFormat": "YYYYMMDD",
    "sequenceDigits": 3,
    "defaultFile": "README.md"
  },
  "frontmatter": {
    "required": ["status", "created"],
    "optional": ["tags", "priority", "assignee", "reviewer"],
    "custom": {}
  },
  "variables": {}
}
```

You can customize this to fit your workflow. See [Configuration Reference](/docs/reference/config) for details.

## Create Your First Spec

Now you're ready to create your first spec:

```bash
lean-spec create my-feature
```

This creates:
- `specs/001-my-feature/` folder (flat structure with global numbering)
- `README.md` inside with your template content
- Frontmatter with default metadata

Edit the `README.md` file to document your feature.

## Basic Commands

Here are the essential commands to get you started:

```bash
# Create a spec
lean-spec create feature-name

# List all specs
lean-spec list

# View a spec
lean-spec view 1

# Update spec metadata (by number or name)
lean-spec update 1 --status=in-progress
lean-spec update feature-name --status=in-progress

# Archive completed specs
lean-spec archive 1
```

For a complete command reference, see [CLI Commands](/docs/reference/cli).

## Visual Mode

LeanSpec includes a web UI for visual spec management. This is great for browsing specs, visualizing dependencies, and presentations.

```bash
# Start the web UI
lean-spec ui

# Or use without installing the CLI
npx @leanspec/ui
```

The UI provides:
- **Interactive Browser**: List and search all specs with rich formatting
- **Dependency Graphs**: Visualize relationships between specs
- **Board View**: Kanban-style view organized by status
- **Project Stats**: Overview of your specs and progress

The UI runs locally on port 3000 and automatically opens in your browser. Your specs are read directly from the filesystem with no setup required.

## AI Integration

LeanSpec works great with AI coding agents. When you ran `lean-spec init`, it created `AGENTS.md` with instructions for AI agents.

### Quick AI Setup

**For AI to access specs through MCP (recommended):**

1. Install LeanSpec globally (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install -g lean-spec
   ```

2. Configure your AI tool:

   **VS Code (GitHub Copilot)** - Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:
   ```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
   {
     "servers": {
       "lean-spec": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@leanspec/mcp"],
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Claude Code** - Add to `.mcp.json`:
   ```json title=".mcp.json"
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "lean-spec": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@leanspec/mcp"],
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Test it:
   ```
   Ask your AI: "List all specs in this project"
   ```

**Without MCP (basic):**
- AI can still read specs from files
- Reference AGENTS.md in your prompts: "Follow instructions in AGENTS.md"
- Manually point AI to spec files when needed

**Learn more**: [MCP Integration](/docs/guide/usage/mcp-integration) for detailed setup and benefits.
