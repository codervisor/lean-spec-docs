# Understanding Specs

This page focuses on how to read, evolve, and maintain LeanSpec documents once you know why they exist.

## Anatomy Refresher
1. **Frontmatter** — status, tags, priority, dates.
2. **Overview** — problem, why now, desired outcome.
3. **Design / Plan** — approach, phases, trade-offs.
4. **Test / Validation** — measurable success criteria.
5. **Notes / Links** — references to related specs or research.

Keep each section purposeful. If details overwhelm the README, extract them into a sub-spec.

## Reading vs. Writing
- **Reading**: Scan frontmatter → overview → success criteria. Decide whether you have enough context to act.
- **Writing**: Start with problem + why now, then capture constraints and definition of done. Add phases only if they help execution.
- **Editing**: Update the spec whenever reality changes. Treat it like code—small commits often beat giant rewrites.

## Keeping Specs Alive
- Update status as soon as work starts or stops.
- Append discoveries or scope changes under a `## Notes` or `## Evolution` section.
- Reference related specs so future readers can follow the thread.
- Run `lean-spec validate` to catch missing metadata or oversize files.

## Spec Evolution Checklist
- ☐ Still under ~2,000 tokens (or split into sub-specs)
- ☐ Problem statement matches current understanding
- ☐ Success criteria remain testable
- ☐ Links point to current files (examples, dashboards, MCP commands)
- ☐ Dependencies reflect real blockers

## Working with AI Agents
1. Share the spec path or use the MCP `search_specs` tool so the agent can load context.
2. Ask the agent to summarize the spec back to you—ensures alignment.
3. Let the agent draft code or documentation; keep the spec updated with outcomes or deviations.
4. After implementation, confirm success criteria and mark the spec complete.
