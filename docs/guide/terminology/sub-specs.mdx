# Sub-Specs

Sub-specs are additional Markdown files inside a spec directory (for example `DESIGN.md`, `TESTING.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`). They let you keep the main README concise while still capturing depth.

## When to Create One
- README exceeds ~300 lines or 2,000 tokens.
- Detailed content (design diagrams, migration steps) would distract from the overview.
- Different audiences need different depths (exec summary vs. implementation detail).

## Common Patterns
```
specs/082-web-sync/
  README.md          # Overview + decision context
  DESIGN.md          # Architecture diagrams and flows
  IMPLEMENTATION.md  # Phases or task list
  TESTING.md         # Test plan, coverage strategy
```

## Benefits
- Preserves Context Economy by partitioning detail.
- Lets AI agents retrieve only the file they need.
- Encourages progressive disclosure—add structure when pain is felt.
