# Spec

A **spec** is a lightweight document that captures intent, constraints, and success criteria for a unit of work. It is written so that both humans and AI agents can understand what needs to happen next.

## Why It Matters
- Acts as persistent memory across handoffs and AI sessions
- Forces clarity on the problem before implementation begins
- Enables autonomous work by outlining success criteria and guardrails

## Anatomy of a LeanSpec
1. **Frontmatter** — machine-readable metadata (status, priority, tags)
2. **Overview** — the problem, why it matters, and desired outcome
3. **Plan** — phases, implementation notes, or acceptance criteria
4. **Test / Validation** — how to confirm the work is done

Keep the main README under ~300 lines (≈2,000 tokens) and push details into sub-spec files when needed.

## Quick Example
```markdown
# 042-api-rate-limiting
Implement token bucket rate limiting (100 req/min per API key)
to protect the API from abuse by 2% of heavy users.
```
