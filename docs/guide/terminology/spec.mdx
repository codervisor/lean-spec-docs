# Spec

A **spec** is a lightweight checkpoint that captures intent, constraints, and success criteria for a unit of work. It tells both humans and AI agents what needs to happen next—and why.

## Why It Matters
- Acts as persistent memory across handoffs and AI sessions
- Forces clarity on the problem before implementation begins
- Enables autonomous work by outlining success criteria and guardrails

## Core Anatomy
1. **Frontmatter** — machine-readable metadata (status, priority, tags, dependencies)
2. **Overview** — the problem, why it matters, and desired outcome
3. **Plan / Design** — phases, trade-offs, or approach notes
4. **Validation** — how to confirm the work is done

Keep the README under ≈2,000 tokens. When it grows beyond working-memory limits, split detail into sub-spec files and link them from the Plan section.

## Sub-Specs: When Depth Matters
Sub-specs are additional Markdown files inside the spec directory (`DESIGN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `TESTING.md`, etc.). They preserve Context Economy by keeping the main README scannable while storing deep detail for specific audiences.

| Use a Sub-Spec When… | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| README would exceed ~2,000 tokens | Architecture diagrams, multi-phase rollout plans |
| Different audiences need different depth | Exec summary in README, implementation checklist elsewhere |
| You need dedicated artifacts | `TESTING.md`, migration runbooks, rollout checklists |

```
specs/082-web-sync/
	README.md          # Overview + decision context
	DESIGN.md          # Architecture diagrams and flows
	IMPLEMENTATION.md  # Phases or task list
	TESTING.md         # Validation details
```

## Quick Example
```markdown
# 042-api-rate-limiting
Implement token bucket rate limiting (100 req/min per API key)
to protect the API from abuse by 2% of heavy users.
```
