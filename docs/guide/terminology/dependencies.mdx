# Dependencies

LeanSpec tracks two relationship types between specs:

## 1. `depends_on` (Blocking)
Use when one spec cannot start until another is complete.
```yaml
# Spec 084
depends_on: [082]
```
- Appears as **→** in `lean-spec deps` output.
- Automatically shows **← Required By** on the other spec.
- Great for migrations, foundational infrastructure, or prerequisite research.

## 2. `related` (Informational)
Use when specs touch the same area but can progress independently.
```yaml
# Spec 043
related: [042]
```
- Appears as **⟷** in dependency graphs.
- Ideal for parallel efforts, shared context, or reusable patterns.

## Good Practices
- Default to `related`; escalate to `depends_on` only if blocked.
- Keep the list small—linking everything to everything reduces value.
- Re-run `lean-spec deps <spec>` after edits to confirm relationships.
