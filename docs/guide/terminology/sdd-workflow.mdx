# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

SDD is the operating rhythm for LeanSpec: capture intent in a spec, let humans and AI execute from it, and keep the spec in sync.

## Five Loop Stages
1. **Discover** — search existing specs before starting new work.
2. **Plan** — create or update a spec so intent is unambiguous.
3. **Implement** — humans and AI agents follow the spec to build.
4. **Validate** — run tests and `lean-spec validate` to ensure quality.
5. **Update** — mark the status, lessons, and follow-ups.

The loop restarts whenever new information appears. Specs are living documents, not ceremonial paperwork.

## Roles in the Workflow
- **Author** clarifies the problem and desired outcome.
- **Implementer** (human or AI) executes the plan.
- **Reviewer** checks success criteria before status changes.

## Tooling Support
- `lean-spec list`, `search`, and `view` for discovery.
- `lean-spec create` and `update` for planning/status.
- `lean-spec validate` and the MCP server for automation.
