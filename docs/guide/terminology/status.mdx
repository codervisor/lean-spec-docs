# Status

A spec's **status** communicates where the work stands in the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow.

## Default Lifecycle
1. **planned** — intent captured, implementation not started.
2. **in-progress** — work is actively happening.
3. **blocked** — external dependency is preventing progress.
4. **complete** — implementation finished and validated.
5. **archived** — historical reference only.

Keep status accurate. Update it the moment implementation starts (not when the spec is written) and again when the work finishes.

## Why Status Matters
- Enables board and timeline views to reflect reality.
- Helps AI agents decide which specs are safe to modify.
- Gives teams instant visibility without meetings.

## Example Frontmatter
```yaml
---
status: in-progress
created: 2025-11-16
priority: high
tags: [api, backend]
---
```
