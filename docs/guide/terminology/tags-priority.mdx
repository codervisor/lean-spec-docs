# Tags & Priority

Tags and priority values make specs filterable and help teams focus.

## Tags
Add descriptive labels that help you slice work quickly.
```yaml
tags: [api, backend, security]
```
- Use consistent vocabulary (`frontend`, `backend`, `docs`).
- Keep to 2-4 tags per spec for clarity.
- Combine with `lean-spec list --tag <tag>` to spotlight relevant specs.

## Priority
Express urgency or business impact.
```yaml
priority: high
```
Typical levels: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`. Update priority when reality changes—old values cause planning debt.

## Why They Matter
- Drive board views, dashboards, and AI triage prompts.
- Help AI agents pick the next most valuable spec.
- Provide lightweight alignment without separate spreadsheets.
