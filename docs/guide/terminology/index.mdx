# LeanSpec Terminology

New contributors should start here before diving into the individual term pages. Each concept below links to its deep-dive page so you can jump straight to the definition you need.

| Term | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| [Spec](/docs/guide/terminology/spec) | Defines the minimal unit of work and how it evolves from idea to implementation. |
| [Status](/docs/guide/terminology/status) | Explains the lifecycle states (`planned`, `in-progress`, `complete`) that power the board and reporting. |
| [SDD Workflow](/docs/guide/terminology/sdd-workflow) | Describes the spec-driven development loop humans and AI agents follow. |
| [Sub-specs](/docs/guide/terminology/sub-specs) | Shows when to split work to stay under Context Economy thresholds. |
| [Dependencies](/docs/guide/terminology/dependencies) | Covers `related` vs `depends_on` so coordination stays clear. |
| [Tags & Priority](/docs/guide/terminology/tags-priority) | Documents the lightweight planning signals that keep specs organized. |
