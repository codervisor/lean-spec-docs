# Your First Spec with AI

Learn how LeanSpec helps you go from intent to implementation in minutes, not hours. You'll build a real feature—dark theme support—with AI doing the heavy lifting.

**Time**: 10 minutes  
**Outcome**: Working feature with a completed spec

:::info Prerequisites
- Completed [Getting Started](/docs/guide/getting-started) guide
- AI tool with MCP configured (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
:::

## Quick Start

Want to follow along with a ready-made example project? Scaffold it instantly:

```bash
npx lean-spec init --example dark-theme
cd dark-theme
npm install
npm start
```

Then ask your AI: _"Help me add dark theme support to this app using LeanSpec"_

Or continue with your own project below...

## The Scenario

You're building a task manager web app. Users love it, but keep requesting dark mode for late-night work sessions. Currently, the app only has a bright light theme.

Starting point:
```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── public/
│   │   ├── index.html           # Task manager UI
│   │   ├── style.css            # Current light theme
│   │   └── app.js               # Task logic
│   └── server.js                # Express server
└── specs/                        # Your specs folder
```

## Creating the Spec

In your AI tool, describe what you want:

```
Create a new spec for adding dark theme support to this task manager.
The theme should:
- Automatically detect system preference
- Use accessible color contrast
- Smooth transition between themes
- Preserve the current design aesthetic

Keep it simple and user-friendly.
```

The AI reads your project structure and creates a spec in `specs/015-dark-theme-support/`. Here's what it generates:

```markdown title="specs/015-dark-theme-support/README.md"

status: planned
created: '2025-11-24'
priority: high

# Dark Theme Support

> **Status**: 📅 Planned · **Priority**: High

## Overview
Add dark theme that automatically switches based on user's system preferences.
Currently only light theme available, causing eye strain in low-light.

## Design
- Use CSS `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Define dark theme color palette (accessible contrast)
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Test with both light/dark system preferences

## Plan
- [ ] Define dark theme color variables
- [ ] Add media query for dark theme
- [ ] Update all color references to use variables
- [ ] Test color contrast for accessibility

## Test
- [ ] Theme switches automatically with system preference
- [ ] All colors meet WCAG AA contrast standards
- [ ] Smooth transitions without flashing
- [ ] Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
```

**What just happened?** The AI:
1. Understood your intent
2. Analyzed your existing CSS structure
3. Created a focused spec with implementation plan
4. Set status to `planned` (ready to build)

## Implementation

Now ask the AI to implement it:

```
Implement spec 015.
```

The AI will:
- Read the spec requirements
- Add CSS color variables for both themes
- Implement the `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Update all hardcoded colors to use variables
- Test the implementation

You'll see updates like:
```
✓ Updated style.css: Added CSS variables for theming
✓ Updated style.css: Added dark theme media query
✓ Updated style.css: Converted colors to variables
✓ Verified: Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
```

## Review and Complete

Test the feature locally:
```bash
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Toggle your system theme (macOS: System Settings > Appearance)
```

The app should smoothly switch between light and dark themes!

Everything works? Tell your AI:
```
Mark spec 015 as complete.
```

Or run manually:
```bash
lean-spec update 015 --status complete
```

The spec now shows:
```markdown
---
status: complete
completed_at: '2025-11-24T16:45:00.000Z'
---
```

## What Just Happened

You experienced spec-driven development with AI:

**Without LeanSpec:**
- Dive into CSS, miss edge cases
- Forget accessibility requirements
- No record of color choices or rationale
- Hard for others to understand decisions

**With LeanSpec:**
- Clear requirements captured upfront
- AI implements with full context
- Design decisions documented
- Accessibility checklist tracked
- Complete audit trail

The spec becomes your **shared memory** between you, the AI, and your team. Everyone knows what was built and why.

## Next Steps

Try it yourself with these enhancements:
- Add manual theme toggle button
- Save user preference in localStorage
- Add more theme variants (high contrast, etc.)
- Extract theme colors to config file

Or pick a different feature from your backlog and follow the same workflow.
