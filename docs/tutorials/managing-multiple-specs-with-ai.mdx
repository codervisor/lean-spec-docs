# Managing Multiple Specs with AI

**Time**: 20-25 minutes  
**Goal**: Use LeanSpec metadata + Copilot Agent Mode to keep four interdependent specs moving without losing track of blockers.

## Scenario
Roadmap items:
1. `user-authentication` — login/signup
2. `shopping-cart` — depends on authentication
3. `product-catalog-api` — backend feed
4. `product-search` — depends on catalog, related to cart

## Step 1: Let AI Build the Relationship Graph (02:00)

```bash
lean-spec list --json > .lean-spec/cache/specs.json
```

Prompt:

```
Load .lean-spec/cache/specs.json and propose dependencies/relationships for the four specs we just created.
Return commands I can run with `lean-spec link`.
```

Paste the suggested commands (review before running):

```bash
lean-spec link shopping-cart --depends-on user-authentication
lean-spec link product-search --depends-on product-catalog-api
lean-spec link product-search --related shopping-cart
```

## Step 2: Capture Priority + Tags via Agent (05:00)
Ask the agent:

```
Set priority/tags based on dependency criticality. Output `lean-spec update` commands only.
```

Example output:

```bash
lean-spec update user-authentication --priority high --tags "auth,backend"
lean-spec update product-catalog-api --priority high --tags "catalog,backend"
lean-spec update shopping-cart --priority medium --tags "cart,frontend"
lean-spec update product-search --priority low --tags "search,frontend"
```

Run the commands, then confirm with `lean-spec list`.

## Step 3: Use AI to Summarize the Board (08:00)

```bash
lean-spec board --json > .lean-spec/cache/board.json
```

Prompt:

```
Given board.json, summarize blockers and recommend next actions.
Highlight any high-priority specs that are still planned.
```

Example summary:
- `user-authentication` — high priority, planned → should start now
- `product-catalog-api` — high priority, planned → run in parallel
- `shopping-cart` — blocked (depends on auth)
- `product-search` — lower priority, but related to cart for shared components

Update statuses accordingly:

```bash
lean-spec update user-authentication --status in-progress
lean-spec update product-catalog-api --status in-progress
```

## Step 4: Ask AI to Monitor Dependencies (12:00)
Whenever a spec status changes, run:

```bash
lean-spec deps shopping-cart --json > .lean-spec/cache/cart-deps.json
```

Prompt idea:

```
Analyze cart-deps.json. Are all blocking specs complete? If yes, craft the command to mark shopping-cart as in-progress and draft a kickoff checklist I can paste into the spec.
```

Result:
- Command: `lean-spec update shopping-cart --status in-progress`
- Checklist snippet to add under `## Plan`

## Step 5: Multi-Spec Status Review Ritual (15:00)
Create a reusable agent macro/text snippet:

```
Run:
1. lean-spec board --json
2. lean-spec stats --json
3. lean-spec search "priority:high status:planned" --json

Combine the results and tell me:
- Which specs are ready but unstarted
- Which in-progress specs have no recent updates
- Any dependencies that remain unresolved
```

Use this check at stand-ups or before starting a new coding session.

## Step 6: Close Specs with AI Assistance (20:00)
After a spec is implemented:

```bash
lean-spec update user-authentication --status complete
lean-spec view user-authentication --json > .lean-spec/cache/auth.json
```

Prompt:

```
Using auth.json, write a short Outcome section summarizing what changed, metrics, and follow-ups. Keep it under 120 words.
```

Append the summary to the spec so future readers (and AI) see how the work ended.

## Toolkit Recap

| Need | Command | Agent Prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discover relationships | `lean-spec list --json` | "Suggest dependencies/relationships as commands." |
| Prioritize | `lean-spec update --priority ...` | "Assign priorities based on blockers." |
| Spot blockers | `lean-spec deps <spec> --json` | "Explain what keeps this spec from moving." |
| Focus stand-up | `lean-spec board --json` | "Summarize statuses + next actions." |
| Close loop | `lean-spec view <spec> --json` | "Draft outcome summary + follow-ups." |

## Checklist
- ☐ Every dependency recorded with `lean-spec link --depends-on`
- ☐ Related work mapped with `--related`
- ☐ Priorities/tags reflect reality (AI can suggest updates)
- ☐ Board reviewed in JSON + summarized by AI
- ☐ Blocked specs note their blockers inside the README
- ☐ Completed specs include outcome notes
