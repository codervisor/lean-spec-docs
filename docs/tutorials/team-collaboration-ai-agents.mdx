# Team Collaboration with AI Agents

**Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Goal**: Stand up a collaboration rhythm where humans, AI agents, and LeanSpec stay fully aligned.

## Prerequisites
- Finish the earlier tutorials (spec authoring, AI-assisted feature work, multi-spec management)
- Share `AGENTS.md` + `specs/` with every teammate’s Copilot agent
- Ensure `lean-spec` CLI is available locally (global install or `npx`)

## Step 1: Morning Sync (5 min)
1. Export state:
   ```bash
   lean-spec board --json > .lean-spec/cache/board.json
   lean-spec stats --json > .lean-spec/cache/stats.json
   lean-spec search "status:blocked" --json > .lean-spec/cache/blocked.json
   ```
2. Prompt Copilot Agent Mode:
   ```
   Read board.json, stats.json, blocked.json. Summarize:
   - High-priority specs still in planned status
   - Blocked specs (who’s blocked + by what)
   - Assignees with >2 in-progress specs
   Return bullet actions.
   ```
3. Paste the bullets into stand-up notes or Slack. Everyone sees the same facts.

## Step 2: Assign & Prioritize (3 min)
Let the agent draft commands:
```
Propose `lean-spec update --assignee` commands so that every high-priority
spec has one owner. Include priority/tag suggestions if they’re missing.
```
Review, run, and commit to the plan:
```bash
lean-spec update dash-api --assignee "Bob" --priority high --tags "backend,sprint-6"
lean-spec update dash-ui --assignee "Alice" --priority high --tags "frontend,sprint-6"
```

## Step 3: Dependency Watch (throughout the day)
When a dependency might unlock work:
```bash
lean-spec deps dash-ui --json > .lean-spec/cache/dash-ui-deps.json
```
Prompt:
```
Read dash-ui-deps.json. Are blockers cleared? If yes, craft the
`lean-spec update` command to mark it in-progress and list the first
three checklist items I should tackle.
```
Paste the response into `## Plan` or `## Notes` so context stays with the spec.

## Step 4: Handoff Pack (5 min)
1. Snapshot the spec:
   ```bash
   lean-spec view comments-service --json > .lean-spec/cache/comments.json
   ```
2. Prompt:
   ```
   Summarize comments-service for Carol:
   - Scope + status
   - Blockers/dependencies
   - Files touched today
   - Command she should run next
   ```
3. Add the summary under `## Handoff Notes`, then:
   ```bash
   lean-spec update comments-service --assignee "Carol"
   ```

## Step 5: Evening Wrap (5 min)
For each spec you touched:
```bash
lean-spec view <spec> --json > .lean-spec/cache/<spec>.json
```
Prompt:
```
Using <spec>.json, write a 3-bullet Outcome covering (1) what shipped,
(2) risks, (3) next action/owner. Keep it under 120 words.
```
Append to the spec before leaving it `in-progress` or marking `complete`.

## Collaboration Roles

| Role | Humans | AI Agents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spec Authors | Capture intent, approve scope changes | Draft sections, propose dependencies, flag missing metadata |
| Implementers | Review diffs, run tests, update status | Apply code changes, summarize failures, suggest fixes |
| Coordinators | Set priorities, negotiate trade-offs | Monitor boards/stats, create stand-up summaries, prep handoff packets |

## Recipe Prompts
- **Stand-up script:** “Given board.json, stats.json, blocked.json, produce Markdown with Ready / Blocked / Completed / Risks sections and assignees.”
- **Load balancing:** “List assignees sorted by in-progress count. Recommend `lean-spec update --assignee` commands to keep ≤2 per person.”
- **Sprint filter:**
  ```bash
  lean-spec search "tag:sprint-12" --json > .lean-spec/cache/sprint-12.json
  ```
  Prompt: “Highlight sprint-12 specs that are still planned after 3 days and suggest nudges.”
- **Meeting prep:** “Summarize specs tagged `frontend-team` that changed status in the last 24h.”

## Checklist for Healthy Collaboration
- ☐ Every active spec has `assignee`, `priority`, `status`
- ☐ Dependencies stay accurate (agents can suggest missing links)
- ☐ Stand-up summaries cite real LeanSpec data files
- ☐ Handoff notes live inside the spec, not just chat
- ☐ Outcome or Notes section updated during wrap-up
- ☐ AI-authored announcements reviewed by a human before sharing externally

## Ready-Made Prompts
- “Summarize everything assigned to @Alice that is still planned.”
- “What blocks specs tagged `frontend-team`? Suggest the next command for each owner.”
- “Draft a GitHub comment recapping spec 082 changes today.”
- “Compare backend vs frontend workload and recommend swaps.”

## Next Steps
1. Automate the JSON exports with a VS Code task so every teammate (and agent) starts with identical data.
2. Standardize a `## Handoff Notes` template in new specs.
3. Revisit [AI-Executable Patterns](/docs/guide/usage/ai-assisted/ai-executable-patterns) to keep implementation prompts sharp.
4. Update `AGENTS.md` with this loop so new agents follow the same cadence.

Keep humans focused on decisions—let AI handle the summaries, reminders, and checklists.
