# Your First Spec

**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Goal**: Experience the complete SDD workflow from creating a spec to marking it complete

## What You'll Learn

- Install and initialize LeanSpec in a project
- Create your first spec with the CLI
- Update spec status as you work
- Use basic commands to manage specs

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed
- Basic familiarity with command line
- A project directory (can be new or existing)

## Step 1: Install LeanSpec

Install LeanSpec globally so it's available everywhere:

```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
lean-spec --version
```

**Expected output**: Version number like `0.2.2`

:::tip
If you prefer project-local installation, use `npm install -D lean-spec` and run commands with `npx lean-spec`.
:::

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory (or create a new one):

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Initialize LeanSpec:

```bash
lean-spec init
```

**What happens:**
1. Interactive prompt appears asking how you'd like to set up
2. Select "Quick start (recommended)"
3. LeanSpec creates:
   - `.lean-spec/config.json` - Configuration
   - `specs/` - Directory for your specs
   - `AGENTS.md` - AI agent integration guide

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Created .lean-spec/config.json
✓ Created specs/ directory
✓ Created AGENTS.md
```

:::info Checkpoint
Run `ls -la` and verify you see `.lean-spec/`, `specs/`, and `AGENTS.md`.
:::

## Step 3: Create Your First Spec

Let's create a spec for a simple feature - adding a search bar to a website.

```bash
lean-spec create search-bar
```

**What happens:**
- Creates `specs/001-search-bar/` directory
- Generates `README.md` inside with template content
- Sets status to `planned` automatically

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Created spec: 001-search-bar
  Location: specs/001-search-bar/README.md
  Status: planned
```

View your new spec:

```bash
lean-spec view 001
```

**Expected output**: The spec content with frontmatter showing `status: planned`.

:::info Checkpoint
Your spec exists! Run `lean-spec list` to see it in the list.
:::

## Step 4: Edit Your Spec

Open the spec file in your editor:

```bash
lean-spec open 001
```

This opens `specs/001-search-bar/README.md` in your default editor.

**Edit the spec** to describe your feature. Replace the template with:

```markdown
---
status: planned
created: 2025-11-17
tags: []
priority: medium
---

# Search Bar Feature

## Overview

Add a search bar to the website header that allows users to search for products.

## Goal

Users can quickly find products by typing keywords into a search bar.

## Design

- Search bar appears in the header on all pages
- Auto-complete shows suggestions as user types
- Pressing Enter navigates to search results page

## Plan

- [ ] Design search bar UI component
- [ ] Implement auto-complete API endpoint
- [ ] Create search results page
- [ ] Add tests for search functionality

## Test

- [ ] Search finds products by name
- [ ] Auto-complete shows relevant suggestions
- [ ] Search works on mobile and desktop
```

Save the file.

:::tip
Keep specs concise! Focus on the "what" and "why", not every implementation detail.
:::

## Step 5: Start Working

Before you begin implementing, update the spec status:

```bash
lean-spec update 001 --status in-progress
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Updated spec: 001-search-bar
  Status: planned → in-progress
```

**What this does:**
- Changes status from `planned` to `in-progress`
- Records the transition with timestamp
- Updates `updated_at` field

:::info Checkpoint
Run `lean-spec view 001` and verify the status shows `in-progress`.
:::

## Step 6: Check Project Status

See your specs at a glance:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 LeanSpec Project Board

Planned          In Progress      Complete
─────────       ─────────────    ──────────
                001-search-bar
```

This Kanban-style view shows specs organized by status.

:::tip
Use `lean-spec board` frequently to track project progress!
:::

## Step 7: Complete Your Spec

After you've implemented the feature (or for this tutorial, we'll pretend you did), mark the spec as complete:

```bash
lean-spec update 001 --status complete
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Updated spec: 001-search-bar
  Status: in-progress → complete
  Completed: 2025-11-17
```

**What this does:**
- Changes status to `complete`
- Records completion date
- Tracks the status transition

View the board again:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 LeanSpec Project Board

Planned          In Progress      Complete
─────────       ─────────────    ──────────
                                 001-search-bar
```

:::success Checkpoint
Your first spec is complete! 🎉
:::

## Step 8: View Project Stats

Get insights into your project:

```bash
lean-spec stats
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 Project Statistics

Overview:
  Total Specs: 1
  Active: 0
  Complete: 1
  Completion Rate: 100%

Status Distribution:
  complete: 1 (100%)
```

## What You Learned

✅ **Installation**: Set up LeanSpec globally  
✅ **Initialization**: Created LeanSpec project structure  
✅ **Creating specs**: Used `lean-spec create` to generate specs  
✅ **Editing specs**: Modified spec content for your feature  
✅ **Status tracking**: Updated status as work progresses  
✅ **Project visibility**: Used `board` and `stats` for overview

## Key Commands Recap

```bash
# Create a spec
lean-spec create <name>

# View a spec
lean-spec view <number>

# Open in editor
lean-spec open <number>

# Update status
lean-spec update <number> --status <status>

# View project board
lean-spec board

# View statistics
lean-spec stats
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting to update status** - Status tracking is how you manage workflow  
❌ **Writing too much detail** - Keep specs lean and focused  
❌ **Skipping the "why"** - Always include the goal and context  
❌ **Never updating specs** - Specs are living documents, update as you learn
