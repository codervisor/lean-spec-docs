# Large Project with Multiple Features

As projects grow beyond a handful of specs, you need better tools to maintain visibility and coordinate work. Learn the essential project management commands for working at scale.

**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Outcome**: Master project management tools for large codebases

:::tip For Advanced Users
This tutorial assumes you're comfortable with basic LeanSpec workflows. If you're new, start with [Your First Spec with AI](./first-spec-with-ai).
:::

## Real-World Example

Want to see these tools in action? Check out the **[LeanSpec project itself](https://web.lean-spec.dev)**—a live example with 100+ specs showing real dependencies, numbering conventions, and project organization.

:::tip Try It Yourself
For the best learning experience, clone the LeanSpec repo locally and explore in visual mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec.git
cd lean-spec
npx @leanspec/cli ui
```

This gives you interactive access to the dependency graph, filtering, and all PM tools.

Throughout this tutorial, we'll reference actual specs from the LeanSpec codebase to show how these patterns work in practice.

## Essential PM Tools

LeanSpec provides five key tools for managing large projects:

1. **`lean-spec board`** - Kanban view of project status
2. **`lean-spec deps <spec>`** - Dependency analysis
3. **`lean-spec stats`** - Project health metrics
4. **`lean-spec list --tags <tags>`** - Filter by team/feature
5. **`lean-spec search <query>`** - Semantic search across specs

Let's explore each one.

## 1. Board View - Project Overview

The board gives you instant visibility into what's happening across your entire project:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

Shows all specs organized by status columns: **Planned** → **In Progress** → **Complete** → **Archived**

**Example from LeanSpec project:**
- Planned: 15 specs (new features, enhancements)
- In Progress: 0 specs (nothing actively being worked on)
- Complete: 64 specs (shipped features)
- Archived: 0 specs

The board also shows project health metrics:
- Completion rate
- Number of blocked specs (waiting on dependencies)
- Recent activity

**Use when:** Starting your day, sprint planning, standup meetings

**Pro tip:** Specs with unmet `depends_on` relationships are flagged as "blocked"

## 2. Dependency Analysis

Understand how specs relate before making changes:

```bash
lean-spec deps <spec> --mode complete
```

Shows three types of relationships:
- **Dependencies** (`depends_on`): What this spec needs before starting
- **Dependents** (`required_by`): What specs need this one
- **Related**: Contextually connected specs

**Real example from LeanSpec:**

```bash
lean-spec deps 114  # Example Projects Scaffold
```

Shows:
- **Related to**: 113 (Tutorial Simplification)
- Both specs work together to improve the tutorial experience

### Impact Analysis

Before refactoring, check the blast radius:

```bash
lean-spec deps <spec> --mode impact
```

Shows:
- Direct dependents (specs that directly depend on this)
- Transitive dependents (specs affected downstream)
- Total impact count

**Use when:** Planning refactors, breaking changes, architectural decisions

**Pro tip:** `--mode upstream` shows only dependencies, `--mode downstream` shows only dependents

## 3. Project Statistics

Get health metrics for your entire project:

```bash
lean-spec stats
```

Shows:
- **Status distribution**: How many specs in each state
- **Priority breakdown**: Critical vs. nice-to-have work
- **Top tags**: Most common categories
- **Recent activity**: Latest spec updates

**Use when:** Sprint reviews, quarterly planning, tracking velocity

**Watch for these red flags:**
- Too many "planned" specs (nothing shipping)
- Too many "in-progress" specs (work not completing)
- No recent activity (project stagnant)

## 4. Filtering and Organization

### By Tags

Organize specs by team, feature area, or technology:

```bash
# See all specs for a team
lean-spec list --tags team-frontend

# See all specs for a feature area
lean-spec list --tags documentation

# See all specs for a milestone
lean-spec list --tags v0.3.0
```

**Real LeanSpec tags:**
- `web`, `cli`, `mcp`, `docs` - Component areas
- `ux`, `dx`, `performance` - Quality attributes
- `v0.2.0`, `v0.3.0` - Release milestones

### By Priority

Focus on critical work:

```bash
lean-spec list --priority critical
lean-spec list --priority high
```

### By Status

Track work in specific states:

```bash
lean-spec list --status planned      # Ready to start
lean-spec list --status in-progress  # Currently active
lean-spec list --status complete     # Shipped
```

## 5. Semantic Search

Find specs by content, not just name:

```bash
lean-spec search "authentication"
lean-spec search "performance optimization"
lean-spec search "dependency graph"
```

Search uses semantic matching—it understands context and finds relevant specs even without exact keywords.

**Use when:** Looking for similar patterns, finding related work, discovering existing solutions

## Organization Patterns

### Numbering Conventions

LeanSpec uses number ranges to group related work:

- **010-029**: Project setup and tooling
- **040-059**: Core features and workflows  
- **060-079**: Advanced features and integrations
- **080-099**: Infrastructure and architecture
- **100+**: Ongoing improvements and polish

**Benefits:**
- See feature area at a glance
- Easy to insert new specs in logical places
- Maintains chronological order within areas

### Tagging Strategy

Effective tags organize work across multiple dimensions:

```bash
# Component tags
web, cli, mcp, docs

# Quality attribute tags
ux, dx, performance, security

# Release milestone tags
v0.2.0, v0.3.0, v0.4.0

# Team/ownership tags (if multi-team)
team-frontend, team-backend, team-infra
```

**Pro tip:** Keep tags consistent across your project. Document your tagging conventions in your README.

## Working with Dependencies

### Creating Dependencies

Link specs when one blocks another:

```bash
# Spec B depends on Spec A completing first
lean-spec link B --depends-on A

# Spec C depends on both A and B
lean-spec link C --depends-on A,B
```

### Creating Soft References

Link related specs without blocking:

```bash
# Specs that share context but don't block each other
lean-spec link A --related B,C
```

**Key difference:** `depends_on` blocks work (hard dependency), `related` provides context (soft reference)

### Removing Links

Clean up outdated relationships:

```bash
lean-spec unlink A --depends-on B    # Remove dependency
lean-spec unlink A --related C       # Remove soft reference
```

## Live Example: LeanSpec Web UI

See all these tools in action at **[web.lean-spec.dev](https://web.lean-spec.dev)**—the LeanSpec project's own spec dashboard.

You'll see:
- 100+ specs organized by status
- Real dependency networks (e.g., spec 114 depends on 113)
- Actual tagging patterns (`docs`, `cli`, `mcp`, `web`)
- Priority distributions across the project
- How numbering conventions work in practice

This is exactly what your project dashboard can look like.

## Tips for Success

### Start Simple

Don't over-organize from day one:
1. Start with basic status tracking
2. Add priority when you need to focus work
3. Add tags when you need better filtering
4. Add dependencies when work starts blocking

### Regular Maintenance

Keep your specs healthy:
- **Daily:** Update status for active work
- **Weekly:** Review board in standup/planning
- **Monthly:** Check for stale specs, update priorities
- **Quarterly:** Archive completed work, audit tags

### Communication Patterns

Use specs for async coordination:
- Check `lean-spec deps` before starting work
- Run `lean-spec board` in standups
- Share `lean-spec stats` in sprint reviews
- Use `lean-spec search` to find context before asking

## What You Learned

You now know how to:

✅ Use `lean-spec board` for project visibility  
✅ Analyze dependencies with `lean-spec deps`  
✅ Track health with `lean-spec stats`  
✅ Filter specs by tags, priority, and status  
✅ Search semantically with `lean-spec search`  
✅ Organize specs with numbering and tagging conventions  
✅ Manage dependencies without creating bottlenecks  

## Next Steps

**Apply to your project:**
- Run `lean-spec board` in your next standup
- Set up a tagging convention in your README
- Check dependencies before starting new work
- Review `lean-spec stats` monthly for health checks
