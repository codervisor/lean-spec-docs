# Writing Your First Spec with AI

**Time**: 10-15 minutes  
**Goal**: Provide intent, let Copilot Agent Mode draft the spec, and land with a reviewed LeanSpec ready for implementation.

> 🎥 Video walkthrough (Loom) — coming soon. Each step below references the timestamp we cover in the demo.

## Prerequisites
- VS Code with [GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-integrated-development-environment/github-copilot-agent-in-visual-studio-code) enabled
- LeanSpec CLI installed globally (`npm install -g lean-spec`) or locally (`npx lean-spec`)
- A workspace containing a `specs/` directory (run `lean-spec init` if you are starting fresh)

## Step 1: Share Intent with the Agent (00:30)
Open VS Code, focus the agent panel, and paste your intent. Example prompt:

```
I want to add passwordless login (magic links) to our SaaS dashboard.
Help me draft a LeanSpec that states the problem, why it matters,
constraints (must keep current MFA), and success criteria for both backend
and UX. Keep it under 2,000 tokens.
```

The agent will request the AGENTS.md instructions if it has not seen them. Approve the file share so it understands project conventions.

## Step 2: Let the Agent Outline the Spec (02:10)
Ask the agent to produce an outline before writing full text:

```
Summarize the spec outline first: Overview, Why Now, Requirements,
Risks, Validation, and Plan. Wait for my approval before expanding sections.
```

Review the outline. If something is missing (for example, "Email service limits"), ask the agent to add it before continuing.

## Step 3: Generate the Draft (04:00)
Give the go-ahead:

```
Looks good. Fill in each section with actionable content and include checklists
for implementation and validation.
```

The agent writes the spec inline. Copy the content into `specs/###-feature/README.md` (use `lean-spec create passwordless-login` if the spec directory does not exist yet).

## Step 4: Review with Lean Principles (06:30)
Walk through the draft and check:

- **Context Economy** — Is the spec under ~300 lines? If not, ask the agent which sections should move to a sub-spec.
- **Signal-to-Noise** — Remove repetition and marketing fluff.
- **Intent Over Implementation** — Ensure "why" is clear before "how".

Helpful prompts:

```
Rewrite the Goals section so each bullet explains the user impact in one sentence.

Suggest a DESIGN.md extraction if we wanted to include sequence diagrams.
```

## Step 5: Validate and Set Status (08:45)
Once the content looks good:

```bash
lean-spec validate passwordless-login
lean-spec update passwordless-login --status planned
```

Share the validation output with the agent if there are warnings. Example prompt:

```
Validation warns that the spec is 2,450 tokens. Reduce the Plan section by
merging related tasks.
```

## Step 6: Capture AI/Human Responsibilities (10:00)
Close the loop by documenting who does what:

- Add a `## Implementation Plan` with checkboxes for human-owned steps.
- Add an `## AI Handoff` section summarizing the files the agent should modify later.

Prompt idea:

```
Add an "AI Handoff" section that lists the repo paths the Copilot agent
should touch when it implements this spec.
```

## Final Checklist
- ☐ Frontmatter set with status `planned`, tags, and priority
- ☐ Spec < 2,000 tokens or split into sub-specs
- ☐ Success criteria and validation steps are explicit
- ☐ AI Handoff section lists next commands/files
- ☐ `lean-spec validate` passes
