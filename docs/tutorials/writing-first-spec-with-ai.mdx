# Your First Feature with AI

Learn how LeanSpec helps you go from intent to implementation in minutes, not hours. You'll build a real feature—email notifications for password resets—with AI doing the heavy lifting.

**Time**: 10 minutes  
**Outcome**: Working feature with a completed spec

:::info Prerequisites
- Completed [Getting Started](/docs/guide/getting-started) guide
- AI tool with MCP configured (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
:::

## Quick Start

Want to follow along with a ready-made example project? Scaffold it instantly:

```bash
npx lean-spec init --example email-notifications
cd email-notifications
npm install
npm start
```

Then ask your AI: _"Help me add email notifications to this app using LeanSpec"_

Or continue with your own project below...

## The Scenario

You're building a user dashboard. Password resets work, but users don't get confirmation emails. You need to add email notifications when someone resets their password.

Starting point:
```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── reset-password.ts    # Existing reset logic
│   └── services/
│       └── email-service.ts     # Email service exists
└── specs/                        # Your specs folder
```

## Creating the Spec

In your AI tool, describe what you want:

```
Create a new spec for adding email notifications to password resets.
Users should receive a confirmation email with:
- Reset confirmation message
- Security tips
- Link to sign in

Use the existing email service. Keep it simple.
```

The AI reads your project structure and creates a spec in `specs/014-reset-email-notifications/`. Here's what it generates:

```markdown title="specs/014-reset-email-notifications/README.md"
---
status: planned
created: '2025-11-24'
priority: medium

# Reset Email Notifications

> **Status**: 📅 Planned · **Priority**: Medium

## Overview
Add confirmation emails when users reset their passwords.
Currently they get no feedback after resetting.

## Design
- Hook into existing `resetPassword()` function
- Use `EmailService.send()` with "password-reset" template
- Include: confirmation message, security tips, sign-in link

## Plan
- [ ] Create email template
- [ ] Add email call to reset-password.ts
- [ ] Add tests for email sending
- [ ] Update user docs

## Test
- [ ] Email sent after password reset
- [ ] Email contains all required elements
- [ ] Error handling if email service fails
```

**What just happened?** The AI:
1. Read your intent
2. Analyzed your codebase structure
3. Created a focused spec with just enough detail
4. Set status to `planned` (ready for implementation)

## Implementation

Now ask the AI to implement it:

```
Implement spec 014.
```

The AI will:
- Read the spec to understand requirements
- Create the email template file
- Add email sending to `reset-password.ts`
- Write tests
- Update the spec's checkboxes as it works

You'll see updates like:
```
✓ Created email template: templates/password-reset.html
✓ Modified: src/auth/reset-password.ts (added email notification)
✓ Added tests: tests/auth/reset-email.test.ts
✓ Updated user documentation
```

## Review and Complete

Test the feature locally:
```bash
npm test
npm run dev
# Try password reset flow
```

Everything works? Tell your AI:
```
Mark spec 014 as complete.
```

Or run manually:
```bash
lean-spec update 014 --status complete
```

The spec now shows:
```markdown
---
status: complete
completed_at: '2025-11-24T15:32:00.000Z'
---
```

## What Just Happened

You experienced spec-driven development with AI:

**Without LeanSpec:**
- Jump into code, forget requirements
- Lose context switching between files
- Hard for others to understand why
- No record of what was delivered

**With LeanSpec:**
- Clear intent captured upfront
- AI implements with full context
- Documented decisions for future you
- Complete audit trail of what shipped

The spec becomes your **shared memory** between you, the AI, and your team. Everyone knows what was built and why.

## Next Steps

Try it yourself:
- Pick a small feature from your backlog
- Ask your AI to create a spec
- Let it implement with the spec as context
- Review and complete
