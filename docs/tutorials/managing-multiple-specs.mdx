# Managing Multiple Specs

**Time**: 20 minutes  
**Goal**: Learn to manage multiple specs with dependencies, relationships, and track progress across them

## What You'll Learn

- Create and organize multiple related specs
- Set up dependencies between specs
- Use relationships to link related work
- Track progress across multiple specs
- Use the board and search effectively

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Your First Spec](./your-first-spec) and [SDD Workflow](./sdd-workflow-feature-development) tutorials
- LeanSpec installed and initialized project

## The Scenario

You're building an e-commerce platform. You need to implement:
1. User authentication (login/signup)
2. Shopping cart functionality (depends on authentication)
3. Product search (independent, but related to catalog)
4. Product catalog API (needed by search)

These specs have dependencies and relationships you need to manage.

## Step 1: Create Multiple Specs

Create specs for all four features:

```bash
lean-spec create user-authentication
lean-spec create shopping-cart
lean-spec create product-search
lean-spec create product-catalog-api
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Created spec: 003-user-authentication
✓ Created spec: 004-shopping-cart
✓ Created spec: 005-product-search
✓ Created spec: 006-product-catalog-api
```

List all specs:

```bash
lean-spec list
```

**Expected output**:
```
📋 Specs (6 total)

  001  search-bar               complete  medium  created: 2025-11-17
  002  task-priority-filter     complete  high    created: 2025-11-17
  003  user-authentication      planned   medium  created: 2025-11-17
  004  shopping-cart            planned   medium  created: 2025-11-17
  005  product-search           planned   medium  created: 2025-11-17
  006  product-catalog-api      planned   medium  created: 2025-11-17
```

:::info Checkpoint
You now have 4 new specs, all starting in `planned` status.
:::

## Step 2: Set Dependencies

The shopping cart depends on user authentication - users must be logged in to add items. Set up this dependency:

```bash
lean-spec link 004 --depends-on 003
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Updated dependencies for spec: 004-shopping-cart
  Depends on: 003-user-authentication
```

Similarly, product search needs the catalog API:

```bash
lean-spec link 005 --depends-on 006
```

:::tip Dependency Rule
Use `depends_on` when spec B **cannot start** until spec A is complete. This creates a blocking dependency.
:::

## Step 3: Set Relationships

Product search and shopping cart are related (both use products) but don't block each other. Create a relationship:

```bash
lean-spec link 005 --related 004
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Updated relationships for spec: 005-product-search
  Related: 004-shopping-cart
```

:::info Related vs Depends On
- **depends_on**: Blocking dependency (can't start B until A is done)
- **related**: Informational link (work is connected but not blocking)

Related links are **bidirectional** - when you link A to B, both specs show the relationship.
:::

## Step 4: View Dependencies

Check dependencies for the shopping cart spec:

```bash
lean-spec deps 004
```

**Expected output**:
```
Dependencies for 004-shopping-cart:

Depends On:
  → 003-user-authentication [planned]

Related Specs:
  ⟷ 005-product-search [planned]
```

Check dependencies for authentication:

```bash
lean-spec deps 003
```

**Expected output**:
```
Dependencies for 003-user-authentication:

Required By:
  ← 004-shopping-cart [planned]
```

Notice how dependencies show from both sides:
- Shopping cart **depends on** authentication (→)
- Authentication is **required by** shopping cart (←)

:::success Understanding Dependencies
This helps you see:
- What must be done before starting a spec (Depends On)
- What's blocked waiting for this spec (Required By)
- What's related for context (Related Specs)
:::

## Step 5: Prioritize Work

Set priorities to guide what to work on first:

```bash
lean-spec update 003 --priority high
lean-spec update 006 --priority high
lean-spec update 004 --priority medium
lean-spec update 005 --priority low
```

Why these priorities?
- **003 (auth)**: High - needed by shopping cart
- **006 (catalog API)**: High - needed by search
- **004 (cart)**: Medium - core feature but depends on auth
- **005 (search)**: Low - nice to have, not critical path

## Step 6: Use Tags for Organization

Add tags to group related specs:

```bash
lean-spec update 003 --tags "authentication,backend,api"
lean-spec update 004 --tags "cart,frontend,feature"
lean-spec update 005 --tags "search,frontend,feature"
lean-spec update 006 --tags "api,backend,catalog"
```

Now search by tag:

```bash
lean-spec search "tag:backend"
```

**Expected output**:
```
🔍 Search results for "tag:backend"

  003  user-authentication    planned   high    [authentication, backend, api]
  006  product-catalog-api    planned   high    [api, backend, catalog]
```

:::tip Organizing with Tags
Use tags to:
- Group by layer (frontend, backend, api)
- Group by type (feature, bugfix, refactor)
- Group by epic (checkout, catalog, user-mgmt)
:::

## Step 7: Track Progress on Board

View the project board:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 LeanSpec Project Board

Planned                        In Progress    Complete
─────────────────────────    ─────────      ──────────────────
003-user-authentication [H]                 001-search-bar
006-product-catalog-api [H]                 002-task-priority-filter
004-shopping-cart [M]
005-product-search [L]

[H] = High Priority, [M] = Medium, [L] = Low
```

The board shows:
- Specs organized by status
- Priority indicators
- Quick visual overview

## Step 8: Start Work on First Spec

Based on dependencies and priority, start with user authentication:

```bash
lean-spec update 003 --status in-progress
```

Update the board:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 LeanSpec Project Board

Planned                        In Progress                Complete
─────────────────────────    ─────────────────────      ──────────────────
006-product-catalog-api [H]  003-user-authentication    001-search-bar
004-shopping-cart [M]                                   002-task-priority-filter
005-product-search [L]
```

## Step 9: Complete Work in Order

Complete authentication:

```bash
lean-spec update 003 --status complete
```

Check what's unblocked:

```bash
lean-spec deps 004
```

**Expected output**:
```
Dependencies for 004-shopping-cart:

Depends On:
  → 003-user-authentication [complete]  ✅

Related Specs:
  ⟷ 005-product-search [planned]
```

Notice the ✅ - the dependency is now satisfied! You can start work on spec 004.

Start shopping cart work:

```bash
lean-spec update 004 --status in-progress
```

## Step 10: View Project Statistics

Get insights into your project:

```bash
lean-spec stats
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 Project Statistics

Overview:
  Total Specs: 6
  Active: 1
  Complete: 3
  Completion Rate: 50%

Status Distribution:
  planned: 2 (33%)
  in-progress: 1 (17%)
  complete: 3 (50%)

Priority Distribution:
  high: 2
  medium: 2
  low: 1
  none: 1

Recent Activity:
  ✓ 004-shopping-cart → in-progress (just now)
  ✓ 003-user-authentication → complete (2 min ago)
  ✓ 003-user-authentication → in-progress (5 min ago)
```

:::success Project Visibility
Stats give you a quick health check:
- Completion rate trending up? ✅
- Too many in-progress? May be spreading thin
- High-priority items not moving? Investigate blockers
:::

## Step 11: Search and Filter

Find all high-priority specs:

```bash
lean-spec search "priority:high"
```

Find all planned backend work:

```bash
lean-spec search "tag:backend status:planned"
```

Find specs about authentication:

```bash
lean-spec search "authentication"
```

**Expected output**:
```
🔍 Search results for "authentication"

  003  user-authentication    complete   high   [authentication, backend, api]
```

## Key Commands Recap

```bash
# Manage dependencies
lean-spec link <spec> --depends-on <other-spec>
lean-spec link <spec> --related <other-spec>
lean-spec deps <spec>

# Set priority and tags
lean-spec update <spec> --priority <high|medium|low>
lean-spec update <spec> --tags "tag1,tag2,tag3"

# Track progress
lean-spec board
lean-spec stats

# Search and filter
lean-spec search "<query>"
lean-spec search "tag:frontend"
lean-spec search "priority:high status:planned"
```

## Dependency Patterns

**Sequential dependencies** (one depends on next):
```bash
lean-spec link 010 --depends-on 009
lean-spec link 009 --depends-on 008
```

**Multiple dependencies** (spec depends on several others):
```bash
lean-spec link 015 --depends-on 012,013,014
```

**Removing dependencies**:
```bash
lean-spec unlink 004 --depends-on 003
```

## Best Practices

**Use dependencies when:**
- Spec B truly cannot start until A is done
- There's a technical dependency (API must exist before UI)
- Work must be done in specific order

**Use relationships when:**
- Specs are related but not blocking
- Context is helpful but not required
- Working on one informs the other

**Set priorities based on:**
- Dependencies (what unblocks other work)
- Business value (what delivers most value)
- Risk (what's most uncertain, do early)

**Use tags for:**
- Quick filtering by category
- Grouping related work
- Sprint planning
- Team assignments
