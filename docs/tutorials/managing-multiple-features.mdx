# Managing Multiple Features

Real projects have multiple features in flight. Learn how to manage them without losing context or duplicating work.

**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Outcome**: Understand project-level spec management

:::info Prerequisites
- Completed [Your First Feature with AI](./first-spec-with-ai)
- Basic familiarity with LeanSpec commands
:::

## Try It Now

Get hands-on with a pre-configured dashboard project:

```bash
npx lean-spec init --example dashboard-widgets
cd dashboard-widgets
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then prompt your AI tool:

<Tabs groupId="ai-tool">
  <TabItem value="claude" label="Claude Code">
    In your terminal with Claude Code:

    ```bash
    # Make sure you have Claude Code installed
    # macOS/Linux
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex

    # Create soft link to CLAUDE.md from the system prompt AGENTS.md
    ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md

    # Send the prompt to Claude Code
    claude "Help me add three new widgets to this dashboard"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="codex" label="Codex CLI">
    In your terminal with OpenAI Codex CLI:

    ```bash
    # Make sure you have Codex CLI installed
    npm install -g @openai/codex

    # Send the prompt to Codex CLI
    codex "Help me add three new widgets to this dashboard"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gemini" label="Gemini CLI">
    In your terminal with Gemini CLI:

    ```bash
    # Make sure you have Gemini CLI installed
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli

    # Create soft link to GEMINI.md from the system prompt AGENTS.md
    ln -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md

    # Send the prompt to Gemini CLI
    gemini "Help me add three new widgets to this dashboard"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="copilot" label="GitHub Copilot CLI">
    In your terminal with GitHub Copilot CLI:

    ```bash
    # Make sure you have GitHub Copilot CLI installed (requires Node.js v22+)
    npm install -g @github/copilot

    # Send the prompt to Copilot CLI (programmatic mode)
    copilot -p "Help me add three new widgets to this dashboard" --allow-all-tools
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ide" label="IDE" default>
    In your IDE with an AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor, etc.):

    1. Open the project in your IDE
    2. Open your AI assistant chat panel
    3. Send the prompt: _"Help me add three new widgets to this dashboard"_
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Want to understand what happens under the hood?** The sections below walk through each step in detail.

## The Scenario

You're building a dashboard with three widgets that need to work together:
1. **List contacts** - Display contact table
2. **Create contact** - Add new contact form
3. **Bulk import** - CSV upload for multiple contacts

Each feature is distinct but shares common code (contact model, validation). You need to track all three without losing sight of dependencies.

Starting point:
```
your-project/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── contact.ts           # Shared model
│   └── components/
│       └── dashboard/
└── specs/
    └── (empty - let's populate it)
```

## Creating Multiple Specs

Ask your AI:

```
Create three specs for dashboard features:
1. List contacts in a table (read-only, pagination)
2. Create contact form (name, email, phone validation)
3. Bulk import contacts from CSV (validation, error handling)

Tag them all with "dashboard" and "contacts".
```

The AI creates:
```
specs/
├── 021-contact-list/
├── 022-contact-create/
└── 023-contact-bulk-import/
```

Each with `status: planned` and tags `['dashboard', 'contacts']`.

## Seeing the Big Picture

List all your specs:
```bash
lean-spec list
```

Output:
```
📋 LeanSpec Project Overview

┌─────┬────────────────────────┬───────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Seq │ Name                   │ Status    │ Priority │ Tags     │
├─────┼────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ 021 │ contact-list           │ planned   │ medium   │ dash...  │
│ 022 │ contact-create         │ planned   │ medium   │ dash...  │
│ 023 │ contact-bulk-import    │ planned   │ high     │ dash...  │
└─────┴────────────────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

Use the board view for workflow status:
```bash
lean-spec board
```

Shows Kanban columns: Planned → In Progress → Complete

**Why this matters:** At a glance, you know what's queued, what's active, and what's done. No spreadsheet needed.

## Finding Related Specs

Search by tag:
```bash
lean-spec list --tags contacts
```

Or ask your AI:
```
Show me all dashboard specs.
```

The AI runs the search and shows you the results with context.

Search by keyword:
```bash
lean-spec search "validation"
```

Finds specs mentioning validation across all content. Perfect for avoiding duplicate work.

## Working in Parallel

Start work on the list feature:
```
Implement spec 021.
```

AI implements the contact list. While that's in review, you start another:
```
Implement spec 022.
```

Check status anytime:
```bash
lean-spec list --status in-progress
```

Shows:
```
│ 021 │ contact-list        │ in-progress │
│ 022 │ contact-create      │ in-progress │
```

**Best practice:** Keep 2-3 specs in-progress max. More than that signals blocked work or context switching overhead.

## Managing Dependencies

Bulk import depends on the contact model and validation from the create form. Document this:

```
Link spec 023 as depending on spec 022 (needs validation logic first).
```

Or manually:
```bash
lean-spec link 023 --depends-on 022
```

Now when you view spec 023:
```markdown
---
depends_on: [022]
---

# Contact Bulk Import

> **Dependencies**: [022-contact-create](../022-contact-create)
```

The AI knows to check spec 022 before implementing 023. It won't start bulk import until contact creation is complete.

**View dependencies:**
```bash
lean-spec deps 023
```

Shows:
```
023-contact-bulk-import
└─ depends on → 022-contact-create
```

## Completing the Project

As you finish each feature:
```bash
lean-spec update 021 --status complete
lean-spec update 022 --status complete
lean-spec update 023 --status complete
```

Check project health:
```bash
lean-spec stats
```

Output:
```

**Satisfaction:** Clear record of what shipped. Future you (or teammates) can see exactly what was built and when.

## What Just Happened

You managed a multi-spec project without chaos:

**Without LeanSpec:**
- Sticky notes or issue tracker for tracking
- No visibility into dependencies
- Hard to find related work
- Status buried in git commits

**With LeanSpec:**
- Single source of truth (`lean-spec list`)
- Dependency tracking prevents ordering mistakes
- Search finds related work instantly
- Status tracking built-in

The CLI commands + AI integration give you project visibility without leaving your editor.

## Key Techniques

**Discovery:**
- `lean-spec list` - See everything
- `lean-spec board` - Visualize workflow
- `lean-spec search` - Find by keyword
- `lean-spec list --tags <tag>` - Filter by category

**Management:**
- `lean-spec deps` - Show dependencies
- `lean-spec link --depends-on` - Document blocking work
- `lean-spec stats` - Project health check
- Multiple specs `in-progress` OK if independent

**AI Integration:**
- Ask "Show me dashboard specs" → AI runs search
- Ask "What's blocking spec X?" → AI checks deps
- Ask "Update spec status" → AI runs command

## Next Steps

Practice with your project:
- Create 2-3 related specs
- Tag them by feature area
- Try `lean-spec list`, `board`, `search`
- Document one dependency
