# Working with Teams

**Time**: 15 minutes  
**Goal**: Learn to use LeanSpec for team collaboration - assigning work, coordinating, and reviewing specs

## What You'll Learn

- Assign specs to team members
- Use priorities for team planning
- Review others' specs effectively
- Coordinate work across multiple people
- Handle spec handoffs

## Prerequisites

- Completed previous tutorials ([Your First Spec](./your-first-spec), [SDD Workflow](./sdd-workflow-feature-development), [Managing Multiple Specs](./managing-multiple-specs))
- LeanSpec installed and initialized project
- Understanding of basic spec operations

## The Scenario

You're on a team of 3 developers building a social media app:
- **Alice** (you): Frontend developer
- **Bob**: Backend developer
- **Carol**: Full-stack developer

You need to coordinate work on the news feed feature, which involves multiple specs.

## Step 1: Create Team Specs

Create specs for different parts of the news feed:

```bash
lean-spec create news-feed-api
lean-spec create news-feed-ui
lean-spec create post-reactions
lean-spec create comment-system
```

**Expected output**:
```
✓ Created spec: 007-news-feed-api
✓ Created spec: 008-news-feed-ui
✓ Created spec: 009-post-reactions
✓ Created spec: 010-comment-system
```

## Step 2: Assign Specs to Team Members

Assign specs based on expertise:

```bash
# Bob will handle the API
lean-spec update 007 --assignee "Bob"

# You (Alice) will build the UI
lean-spec update 008 --assignee "Alice"

# Carol will implement reactions
lean-spec update 009 --assignee "Carol"

# Comment system TBD
```

**Expected output** (for each):
```
✓ Updated spec: 007-news-feed-api
  Assignee: Bob
```

List specs to see assignments:

```bash
lean-spec list
```

**Expected output**:
```
📋 Specs (10 total)

  ...
  007  news-feed-api       planned  medium  @Bob    created: 2025-11-17
  008  news-feed-ui        planned  medium  @Alice  created: 2025-11-17
  009  post-reactions      planned  medium  @Carol  created: 2025-11-17
  010  comment-system      planned  medium          created: 2025-11-17
```

:::tip Assignee Format
Use simple names or GitHub usernames. LeanSpec doesn't enforce format - use what works for your team.
:::

## Step 3: Set Up Dependencies

The UI depends on the API:

```bash
lean-spec link 008 --depends-on 007
```

Reactions and comments are related but independent:

```bash
lean-spec link 009 --related 010
```

## Step 4: Prioritize as a Team

Set priorities for the sprint:

```bash
lean-spec update 007 --priority high --tags "backend,api,sprint-1"
lean-spec update 008 --priority high --tags "frontend,ui,sprint-1"
lean-spec update 009 --priority medium --tags "feature,sprint-2"
lean-spec update 010 --priority low --tags "feature,backlog"
```

:::info Sprint Planning
Use priorities + tags to mark sprint work:
- **high** priority + **sprint-1** tag = current sprint
- **medium** priority + **sprint-2** tag = next sprint
- **low** priority + **backlog** tag = future work
:::

## Step 5: View Team Board

Check who's working on what:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 LeanSpec Project Board

Planned                        In Progress    Complete
─────────────────────────    ─────────      ──────────────
007-news-feed-api [H] @Bob                  001-search-bar
008-news-feed-ui [H] @Alice                 002-task-priority-filter
009-post-reactions [M] @Carol               003-user-authentication
010-comment-system [L]
...
```

Now you can see:
- What each person is assigned
- Priority of their work
- Current status

## Step 6: Bob Starts His Work

Bob picks up the API spec:

```bash
lean-spec update 007 --status in-progress
```

Check the board again:

```bash
lean-spec board
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 LeanSpec Project Board

Planned                        In Progress              Complete
─────────────────────────    ───────────────────────  ──────────────
008-news-feed-ui [H] @Alice  007-news-feed-api @Bob   001-search-bar
009-post-reactions [M] @Carol                         ...
010-comment-system [L]
...
```

## Step 7: Check Your Blocked Work

Alice (you) wants to start the UI, but it depends on Bob's API:

```bash
lean-spec deps 008
```

**Expected output**:
```
Dependencies for 008-news-feed-ui:

Depends On:
  → 007-news-feed-api [in-progress] @Bob  ⏳

Status: Waiting for dependencies
```

The ⏳ indicates the dependency is in progress - you're blocked.

:::info Blocked Work
When a spec depends on in-progress work, you can:
1. Work on other specs (009, 010)
2. Help Bob finish 007 faster
3. Prepare 008 (write tests, mock the API)
:::

## Step 8: Bob Completes the API

Bob finishes the API:

```bash
lean-spec update 007 --status complete
```

Check your dependency again:

```bash
lean-spec deps 008
```

**Expected output**:
```
Dependencies for 008-news-feed-ui:

Depends On:
  → 007-news-feed-api [complete] @Bob  ✅

Status: Ready to start
```

Now you can start! ✅

## Step 9: Review Bob's Spec

Before implementing the UI, review Bob's API spec to understand the contract:

```bash
lean-spec view 007
```

Look for:
- **API endpoints**: What URLs are available?
- **Data format**: What JSON structure does it return?
- **Error handling**: How are errors communicated?
- **Success criteria**: What tests were done?

If anything is unclear, talk to Bob or update the spec with clarifications.

:::tip Spec Review Checklist
When reviewing specs:
- [ ] Goal is clear and measurable
- [ ] Design decisions are documented
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] Non-goals are explicit
- [ ] Related specs are linked
:::

## Step 10: Search for Your Work

Find all specs assigned to you:

```bash
lean-spec search "assignee:Alice"
```

Find all your current sprint work:

```bash
lean-spec search "tag:sprint-1 assignee:Alice"
```

Find unassigned specs:

```bash
lean-spec search "assignee:"
```

**Expected output**:
```
🔍 Search results for "assignee:"

  010  comment-system    planned   low
```

## Step 11: Coordinate Across Specs

Carol asks about post reactions - are there any related specs she should know about?

```bash
lean-spec deps 009
```

**Expected output**:
```
Dependencies for 009-post-reactions:

Related Specs:
  ⟷ 010-comment-system [planned]
```

Carol sees that reactions are related to comments - she might want to coordinate design with whoever picks up 010.

## Step 12: Handoff a Spec

Alice decides to hand off the comment system to Bob (who finished his API work):

```bash
lean-spec update 010 --assignee "Bob"
```

Bob can see his new assignment:

```bash
lean-spec search "assignee:Bob"
```

**Expected output**:
```
🔍 Search results for "assignee:Bob"

  007  news-feed-api     complete  high    @Bob
  010  comment-system    planned   low     @Bob
```

:::tip Handoff Best Practice
When handing off a spec:
1. Ensure the spec is up-to-date
2. Add handoff notes in the spec (why, context)
3. Notify the new assignee
4. Make sure they understand dependencies
:::

## Step 13: Team Statistics

Check team progress:

```bash
lean-spec stats
```

**Expected output**:
```
📊 Project Statistics

Overview:
  Total Specs: 10
  Active: 0
  Complete: 4
  Completion Rate: 40%

Assignee Distribution:
  Alice: 1 spec (1 planned)
  Bob: 2 specs (1 complete, 1 planned)
  Carol: 1 spec (1 planned)
  Unassigned: 6 specs

Tag Distribution:
  sprint-1: 2 specs
  sprint-2: 1 spec
  backlog: 1 spec
```

This helps with:
- Load balancing (who has too much/too little work)
- Sprint tracking (how many sprint-1 specs are done)
- Identifying bottlenecks

## What You Learned

✅ **Assigning work**: Used `--assignee` to assign specs  
✅ **Team planning**: Combined priorities and tags for sprints  
✅ **Coordination**: Used dependencies to manage work order  
✅ **Visibility**: Board and stats show team progress  
✅ **Searching**: Found work by assignee, tag, status  
✅ **Reviewing**: Checked specs before implementation  
✅ **Handoffs**: Reassigned work between team members

## Key Commands Recap

```bash
# Assign work
lean-spec update <spec> --assignee "Name"

# Find your work
lean-spec search "assignee:Alice"

# View team board
lean-spec board

# Check dependencies
lean-spec deps <spec>

# Review a spec
lean-spec view <spec>

# Team stats
lean-spec stats
```

## Team Collaboration Patterns

**Sprint Planning**:
```bash
# Tag specs for current sprint
lean-spec update 015 --tags "sprint-5,frontend"
lean-spec update 016 --tags "sprint-5,backend"

# Find sprint work
lean-spec search "tag:sprint-5"
```

**Daily Standup**:
```bash
# What's in progress?
lean-spec board

# What's blocked?
lean-spec deps <spec-number>

# Who's working on what?
lean-spec search "status:in-progress"
```

**Load Balancing**:
```bash
# Check team workload
lean-spec stats

# Find unassigned work
lean-spec search "assignee:"

# Find who has least work
lean-spec search "assignee:Alice"
lean-spec search "assignee:Bob"
```

## Team Best Practices

**1. Clear Assignments**
- Assign specs at the start of sprint
- One assignee per spec (avoid shared ownership confusion)
- Reassign explicitly if someone picks up another's work

**2. Document Handoffs**
- Add notes to spec explaining handoff context
- Update Design or Notes section with decisions made
- Ensure new assignee reviews spec and asks questions

**3. Review Before Starting**
- Always review dependent specs before starting work
- Look for API contracts, data formats, error handling
- Ask questions if anything is unclear

**4. Keep Specs Current**
- Update status as work progresses
- Document learnings and changes
- Complete specs properly (don't leave orphaned in-progress work)

**5. Use Tags Strategically**
- Sprint tags (sprint-1, sprint-2)
- Team tags (frontend-team, backend-team)
- Epic tags (checkout-epic, user-mgmt)
- Type tags (feature, bugfix, refactor)

**6. Regular Check-ins**
- Review board in standup
- Check stats weekly for health
- Identify blockers early

## Common Team Scenarios

**Parallel Work**:
```bash
# Alice and Bob work independently
lean-spec update 020 --assignee "Alice" --status in-progress
lean-spec update 021 --assignee "Bob" --status in-progress
```

**Blocked Work**:
```bash
# Check what's blocking Alice
lean-spec deps 020

# If blocked, work on something else
lean-spec search "assignee:Alice status:planned"
```

**Cross-team Dependencies**:
```bash
# Frontend depends on backend
lean-spec link 025 --depends-on 024

# Both teams can see the dependency
lean-spec deps 024  # Backend sees who needs them
lean-spec deps 025  # Frontend sees who they're waiting for
```
