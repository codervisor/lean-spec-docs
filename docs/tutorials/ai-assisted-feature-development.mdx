# AI-Assisted Feature Development

**Time**: 30-40 minutes  
**Goal**: Go from spec → AI plan → human validation → shipped feature without losing alignment.

## Scenario
Add "Priority filters" to a task list. Users should toggle High, Medium, Low, or All. Filter choice must persist between sessions.

## Prerequisites
- Completed [Writing Your First Spec with AI](./writing-first-spec-with-ai)
- Spec created via `lean-spec create task-priority-filter`
- GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with MCP access to the repo (`AGENTS.md` shared)

## Step 1: Ground the Agent (01:00)
1. Run `lean-spec view task-priority-filter` to confirm the spec is up to date.
2. In the agent chat, share the file path:

```
Please read specs/002-task-priority-filter/README.md. Confirm back the
goal, success criteria, and plan phases in your own words.
```

3. Wait for the summary. If it misses a detail (for example, persistence), reply:
   `Call out persistence explicitly—where should state live?`

## Step 2: Ask for an Implementation Plan (04:00)
Prompt:

```
Create a step-by-step implementation plan referencing the spec sections.
Break it into commits I can apply sequentially.
```

Expect something like:
- Commit 1: Filter UI scaffold
- Commit 2: State + filtering logic
- Commit 3: Persistence + tests

Copy the plan into the spec under `## Plan` or `## Implementation Notes` so progress stays visible.

## Step 3: Execute Phase-by-Phase (08:00)
For each phase, follow this loop:

1. **Prompt**

```
Implement Phase 1 from the plan: build FilterBar.tsx with buttons and active states.
Focus only on UI wiring—no persistence yet.
```

2. **Review the diff**. Ask the agent to explain any non-trivial change.
3. **Update the spec** with checkboxes:

```markdown
**Phase 1: UI Shell** ✅
- [x] Filter buttons render above list
- [x] Active state highlighted
- [x] Emits `onFilterChange` callback
```

Repeat for later phases (logic, persistence, tests). Keep prompts scoped to the current phase to maintain Context Economy.

## Step 4: Handle Mid-Spec Changes (16:00)
If you discover a new requirement—say, showing task counts per filter—update the spec first:

```markdown
## Design (update)
- Each filter button shows `Label (count)` based on the cached task list.
```

Then tell the agent:

```
Specs updated: filter buttons must show counts.
Modify FilterBar and the data hook accordingly. Keep scope inside Phase 2.
```

Document the change in a `## Notes` or `## Evolution` section so future readers know why scope shifted.

## Step 5: Validate with Commands (22:00)

```bash
npm test
lean-spec validate task-priority-filter
```

Share failures with the agent verbatim. Prompt idea:

```
Tests failing: Filter state does not persist. Here's the error...
Debug using the spec's persistence criteria.
```

Keep iterating until both commands pass.

## Step 6: Close the Loop (30:00)
1. Update the spec:

```bash
lean-spec update task-priority-filter --status complete
```

2. Add a short `## Outcome` section summarizing:
   - Metrics (token count, test coverage)
   - What changed from the original plan
   - Links to PR/commit

3. Paste the final spec link back to the agent so it can learn from the finished work.

## Observed Benefits
- **Human clarity**: Specs stayed truthful as requirements changed.
- **AI autonomy**: Agent operated on scoped phases with explicit success criteria.
- **Traceability**: Board/status updates show exactly when the feature shipped.

## Checklist
- ☐ Agent summarized the spec before coding
- ☐ Implementation plan lives inside the spec
- ☐ Spec updated after each phase
- ☐ Tests + `lean-spec validate` pass
- ☐ Status marked `complete` with outcome notes
