# LeanSpec Dogfooding: Real SDD Case Studies

How does LeanSpec use its own methodology? This section documents real-world examples from LeanSpec's own development, showing SDD in action across different scenarios.

## Why Case Studies?

LeanSpec has 90+ specs documenting its own development. These case studies show:
- **How specs guided implementation** - From planning to completion
- **Real challenges and solutions** - Not just success stories
- **Spec evolution during development** - How specs changed as we learned
- **AI agent collaboration** - How AI agents used specs to contribute code

## Featured Case Studies

### 🎯 [Simple Feature: Token Validation](./simple-feature-token-validation)
**Spec 071 - Simplified Token-Based Validation**

A focused, single-concern spec showing the classic SDD workflow:
- Small scope (token threshold validation)
- Clear problem → solution → implementation flow
- Completed in one development session
- Demonstrates Context Economy principle

**Key Lesson**: Keep specs focused on one concern for fast execution.

### 🏗️ [Complex Feature: Web Realtime Sync](./complex-feature-web-sync)
**Spec 082 - Web App Realtime Spec Sync Architecture**

A large, multi-phase architectural spec demonstrating:
- Breaking down complex problems into sub-specs
- Managing scope across multiple work sessions
- Evolving design as implementation reveals constraints
- Using spec relationships to coordinate work

**Key Lesson**: Large specs need sub-specs and clear phase boundaries.

---

### 🔄 [Refactoring: Monorepo Core Extraction](./refactoring-monorepo-core)
**Spec 067 - Monorepo Structure & Core Package Extraction**

A breaking change requiring careful coordination:
- Dependency analysis before refactoring
- Risk management for breaking changes
- Clear migration path documentation
- Spec-driven refactoring prevents regressions

**Key Lesson**: Specs de-risk refactors by forcing explicit planning.

---

### 🤝 [Cross-Team Feature: Official Launch](./cross-team-official-launch)
**Spec 043 - Official Launch v0.2.0**

Coordinating multiple related specs across a major release:
- Managing spec relationships and dependencies
- Balancing competing priorities
- Adapting plan based on discovered constraints
- Using specs for team alignment

**Key Lesson**: Specs enable coordination without constant meetings.

## What You'll Learn

Each case study includes:

1. **Context** - What problem were we solving?
2. **The Spec** - Link to actual spec in GitHub
3. **Implementation** - How we built it
4. **Evolution** - What changed during development
5. **Outcome** - Results and metrics
6. **Lessons** - What worked, what we'd do differently
7. **AI Agent Collaboration** - How AI agents contributed

## Common Themes

Across all case studies, you'll see:

- **Specs as living documents** - They evolve as you learn
- **First principles in action** - Context Economy, Signal-to-Noise, Intent Over Implementation
- **Real challenges** - We show mistakes and course corrections
- **AI agent success** - Specs enable autonomous AI contributions
- **Measurable outcomes** - Token counts, build times, error rates

## Not Just Success Stories

We document both successes and challenges:
- Specs that needed splitting mid-implementation
- Design decisions that changed after coding started
- Trade-offs we made and their consequences
- Times when we violated our own principles (and learned from it)

**Philosophy**: Show the real process, not a sanitized version. SDD works because it adapts to reality, not because it's perfect.

## Your Turn

After reading these case studies, try applying SDD to:
1. **A simple feature** - Start with something you can complete in one session
2. **A refactor** - Use a spec to de-risk the changes
3. **An architectural decision** - Document trade-offs before coding
