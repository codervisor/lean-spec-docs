# LeanSpec Philosophy

> "The best spec is the one that gets read, understood, and acted upon—by humans and AI alike."

## What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a **mindset, methodology, and adaptive workflow**—not just a format. It's about capturing what truly matters with minimal overhead.

### The Problem

Traditional software specifications often suffer from:
- **Documentation Overload**: Lengthy documents that nobody (human or AI) reads or maintains
- **Frozen Contracts**: Specs that become outdated as soon as development begins
- **Exhaustive Overthinking**: Trying to document every possible edge case upfront
- **Mind Burden**: Cognitive load from managing verbose, complicated documentation
- **Lost Intent**: The "why" gets buried under mountains of "what" and "how"

Development teams—including AI coding agents—need clear direction without being buried in documentation debt.

## Core Principles

LeanSpec is built on these agile principles:

### 🎯 Clarity over Documentation
Write just enough to communicate intent clearly. If it doesn't add clarity, don't write it.

### 🚀 Essential Scenarios over Exhaustive Lists
Focus on the 20% of scenarios that deliver 80% of the value. Document what must work, not every possible edge case.

### 📱 Living Guide over Frozen Contract
Specs should evolve with the project. Update them as you learn, don't treat them as immutable contracts.

### 🧠 Reduced Mind Burden over Comprehensive Coverage
Keep specs short and scannable. The goal is to reduce cognitive load, not create reference manuals.

### ⚡ Speed over Perfection
Ship a "good enough" spec quickly. You can always refine it based on feedback and learning.

### 🤝 Collaboration over Specification
Use specs as conversation starters, not as replacements for human communication.

## The LeanSpec Mindset

A simple example structure might include:
- **The Goal**: Why this work exists
- **Key Scenarios**: The critical user journeys that must succeed
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable conditions for "done"
- **Technical Contracts**: Essential interfaces and constraints
- **Non-Goals**: What we're explicitly not doing (to maintain focus)

But the key is the mindset: focus on clarity, keep it lean, make it living documentation. The structure should serve your needs, not constrain them.

## Getting Started with the Mindset

The LeanSpec mindset is simple:

1. **Start with why**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Capture the essentials**: What absolutely must be communicated?
3. **Stay lean**: If it doesn't add clarity, cut it
4. **Keep it living**: Update as you learn

## When to Use LeanSpec

**Perfect for:**
- New features or components
- API designs
- Architecture decisions that need shared understanding
- Quick alignment on work direction
- Providing context to AI coding agents for implementation tasks
- Establishing an adaptive SOP for AI-powered development teams
- Integrating with system prompts and agent instructions

**Not ideal for:**
- Detailed API reference documentation (use code comments + auto-generated docs)
- Step-by-step user manuals (use dedicated user documentation)
- Compliance requirements that mandate specific formats

## Adapt to Your Needs

LeanSpec embraces agile thinking: start small, iterate based on feedback, and focus on outcomes over outputs. A one-page spec that everyone (including AI coding agents) understands beats a fifty-page document that nobody reads.

The methodology is about principles over process—adapt it to your team, your tools, and your context.
