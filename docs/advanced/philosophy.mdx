# Philosophy & Mindset

> "LeanSpec is a mindset, not a format."

Beyond the [First Principles](/docs/advanced/first-principles), effective LeanSpec practice requires adopting key mental models and beliefs about how specs should work.

## Mental Models for AI Co-Creation

When AI assists in writing specs (not just implementing from them), three mental models guide how specs fit into your workflow:

### Spec-as-Checkpoint (Primary Model)

**What it is:** Formalize intent at key decision points in the development conversation.

**Workflow:**
1. **Converse with AI** - Explore options, clarify requirements, iterate on design
2. **Recognize checkpoint** - When design is clear enough to formalize
3. **Crystallize into spec** - AI drafts initial spec, human refines
4. **Continue from spec** - Spec becomes contract for implementation

**When to use:**
- After clarifying complex design with AI
- Before starting multi-phase implementation
- When ready to commit to an approach
- To capture decisions before moving forward

**Example:** You discuss API design with AI for 15 minutes, clarify constraints and trade-offs, then formalize the agreed design as a spec before implementation begins.

### Spec-as-Artifact (Formal Documentation)

**What it is:** Durable documentation that persists beyond the immediate work.

**Purpose:**
- Reference for future modifications
- Onboarding for new team members
- Compliance and audit trails
- Institutional knowledge capture

**When to use:**
- Architectural decisions affecting multiple systems
- Features requiring regulatory documentation
- Complex designs others will extend
- Work that needs future reference

**Example:** A payment processing spec that documents security decisions, PCI compliance approach, and integration patterns for future developers.

### Spec-as-Context (Living Documentation)

**What it is:** Evolving context that grows alongside implementation.

**Characteristics:**
- Updated iteratively as understanding grows
- Reflects current reality, not just initial plans
- Bridges ongoing human-AI collaboration
- Captures learnings and refinements

**When to use:**
- SDD-style iterative development
- Complex features with emergent requirements
- Long-running work with multiple iterations
- When spec serves as living project memory

**Example:** A refactoring spec that evolves as you discover new patterns, documents decisions as you make them, and captures what worked vs. what didn't.

### Choosing Your Mental Model

Most specs move through these phases:

1. **Start as Checkpoint** - Formalize conversation into spec
2. **Evolve as Context** - Update as implementation teaches you things
3. **End as Artifact** - Archive as reference documentation

**The key insight:** These aren't separate approaches—they're stages in a spec's lifecycle. Start simple (checkpoint), evolve naturally (context), finish as documentation (artifact).

**For AI-assisted authoring:**
- AI helps draft the checkpoint (structure your thoughts)
- AI helps maintain context (update as you learn)
- Humans ensure artifact quality (refine for clarity)

## The LeanSpec Mindset

To practice LeanSpec effectively, adopt these core attitudes:

### Start with Why

Every spec should answer: "Why does this work exist?"

- What problem are we solving?
- Why is it important?
- Why now?

Without clear answers, the work may not be worth doing.

### Embrace "Good Enough"

Perfectionism is the enemy of lean specifications.

- Ship a "good enough" spec quickly
- Get feedback from real work
- Refine based on what you learn
- Iterate continuously

A perfect spec that's never written is worthless. An imperfect spec that gets work moving is valuable.

### Question Every Word

Before writing anything, ask: "Does this add clarity?"

If not, don't write it.

- Verbose explanations → brief, clear statements
- Exhaustive edge cases → critical scenarios only
- Academic formality → conversational clarity
- Comprehensive references → essential links

### Think Living Document

Specs are not contracts carved in stone. They're living guides that evolve.

- Update specs as you learn
- Capture decisions as you make them
- Reflect reality, not just plans
- Archive when work is complete

A spec that's out of date is worse than no spec at all.

### Design for Scanning

People (and AI agents) scan before they read.

Structure specs for quick comprehension:
- Use clear headings
- Keep sections short
- Use bullet points
- Highlight key information
- Add visual elements (emojis, badges) where helpful

If someone can't understand your spec in 2 minutes, it's probably too long.

## Core Beliefs

The LeanSpec approach is guided by four foundational beliefs:

### 1. Documentation is a Means, Not an End

The goal isn't to create comprehensive documentation. The goal is to **enable effective action**.

- Specs exist to facilitate understanding and decision-making
- If nobody reads or uses a spec, it has failed—regardless of how thorough it is
- Value delivered to users > documentation completeness

### 2. Context Beats Comprehensiveness

Capturing **why** something matters is more valuable than exhaustively documenting **what** it is.

- Understanding the problem is more important than detailing the solution
- The "why" rarely changes, but the "how" evolves constantly
- Context enables good decisions; exhaustive details become outdated quickly

### 3. Specs Should Reduce Burden, Not Create It

Traditional specs often become a burden (too long to read, too complex to maintain, too rigid to adapt).

LeanSpec specs should:
- Take minutes to read
- Be easy to keep current
- Evolve with the project
- Invite collaboration

### 4. AI Changes Everything

In the era of AI-assisted development, specs serve a dual purpose:
- **Human Communication**: Align team understanding
- **AI Context**: Provide clear direction for AI coding agents

AI agents benefit from the same qualities humans do: clear, concise writing with concrete examples, explicit boundaries, and testable criteria.

## Balancing Lean and Complete

The goal isn't to write as little as possible. The goal is to write **as much as necessary**.

Some features are complex and require detailed specs. That's okay. The question isn't "How short can I make this?" but rather "What's essential for understanding?"

### When to Add More Detail

Add detail when:
- Complexity demands it
- Ambiguity would cause problems
- Coordination across teams is needed
- Technical constraints are critical
- Failure has high consequences

### When to Cut Detail

Cut detail when:
- It's obvious to your audience
- It's easily discovered elsewhere
- It might change before work begins
- It's tangential to the core goal
- It's implementation detail for later

## AI-Assisted Spec Authoring

AI can help write specs, not just implement from them. This creates a collaborative workflow:

**Human provides:**
- Intent and context ("Why are we doing this?")
- Constraints and trade-offs ("What limits exist?")
- Success criteria ("How do we know it's done?")
- Refinement and editing (enforce LeanSpec principles)

**AI provides:**
- Initial structure and draft
- Expansion of brief notes into sections
- Examples and test cases
- Formatting and organization

**Result:** Faster spec creation that still maintains human judgment on what matters. AI handles structure, humans ensure clarity and intent.

**Critical:** First principles matter MORE in AI-assisted authoring. Without human review, AI tends toward verbosity (violating Signal-to-Noise) and implementation focus (violating Intent Over Implementation). Your role is to ensure specs remain lean and purposeful.

## Success Criteria

How do you know if you're practicing LeanSpec effectively?

### Self-Check Questions

**Context Economy:**
- [ ] Can someone read this spec in 5-10 minutes?
- [ ] Is each spec file under 400 lines?
- [ ] If not, is it split into focused sub-specs?

**Signal-to-Noise:**
- [ ] Does every sentence inform a decision?
- [ ] Can I explain what decision each section enables?
- [ ] Have I cut "nice to know" vs. "need to know"?

**Intent Over Implementation:**
- [ ] Is the "why" clear?
- [ ] Are trade-offs explained?
- [ ] Can someone make good decisions without me?

**Bridge the Gap:**
- [ ] Can both humans and AI understand this?
- [ ] Is there clear structure + natural language?
- [ ] Are examples included where needed?

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- [ ] Did I add only what I need now?
- [ ] Am I solving current pain, not future "what ifs"?
- [ ] Can this grow naturally without rewriting?

### Your Specs Are Successful If:

✅ **They get read** - People actually read them (all the way through)  
✅ **They get used** - They inform actual development work  
✅ **They stay current** - They're updated as the project evolves  
✅ **They enable autonomy** - Developers can work without constant clarification  
✅ **They facilitate AI** - AI agents can implement features from them  
✅ **They age well** - They remain useful even after implementation

### Your Specs Are Failing If:

❌ People say "TL;DR" (too long; didn't read)  
❌ Developers ignore them and ask for clarification  
❌ They become outdated quickly  
❌ They generate more questions than answers  
❌ AI agents misinterpret them  
❌ They're never referenced after initial review

## The Bottom Line

LeanSpec is a **mindset**, not a format.

Focus on:
- **Why** over what
- **Clarity** over completeness
- **Action** over documentation
- **Evolution** over perfection

If your specs help people (and AI agents) build better software faster, you're doing LeanSpec right.
