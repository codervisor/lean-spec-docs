# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is a lightweight spec framework optimized for AI-assisted development. It's a CLI tool + markdown files that live in your repo, helping you document technical decisions and guide AI coding tools while keeping specs under 300 lines for optimal performance.

**Key features:**
- Numbered specs for easy reference
- CLI tools for creating, searching, and managing specs
- MCP server for AI tool integration (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Validation to ensure spec quality
- Kanban board and stats for project visibility

**5-minute setup:**

```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
cd your-project
lean-spec init
lean-spec create my-first-spec
```

No configuration files, no database, no server. Works with any editor and any AI tool.

## Why use LeanSpec?

**Use LeanSpec when you need:**
- Team alignment on complex features
- Documentation for design decisions
- Context to reduce AI hallucinations
- Onboarding materials for new team members

**Skip LeanSpec for:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Throwaway prototypes
- Solo projects with clear requirements

**Philosophy:** Get 80% of vibe coding speed with 80% of structured spec benefits. Minimal overhead for maximum agility.

## Why the 300-line limit?

**Attention is the scarce resource, not storage.**

Three reasons:
1. **Human attention span** - Read and understand in 5-10 minutes
2. **AI performance** - Context quality degrades beyond 50K tokens
3. **Working memory** - Keep specs cognitively manageable

If your spec exceeds 300 lines, split it into sub-spec files (`DESIGN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `TESTING.md`, etc.). See [First Principles](/docs/advanced/first-principles#1-context-economy-) for details.

## Troubleshooting

### My spec was corrupted by AI editing it

**Cause:** Spec exceeded context window, AI lost track of structure.

**Fix:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- specs/042-my-spec/  # Restore from git
lean-spec validate                        # Check for issues
```

**Prevention:** Keep specs under 300 lines (warning at 300, error at 400).

### `lean-spec update` says "spec not found"

**Debug:**
```bash
lean-spec list          # See all active specs
lean-spec list --all    # Include archived
```

**Common causes:**
- Not in git repo with `specs/` directory
- Typo in spec name/number
- Spec was archived

### Frontmatter validation failed

**Common mistakes:**
- Manually editing system-managed fields (`status`, `created_at`, `transitions`, etc.)
- Invalid YAML syntax
- Typos in field names

**Fix:**
```bash
lean-spec validate      # See exactly what's wrong
```

**Always use CLI commands** to update metadata:
```bash
lean-spec update 042 --status in-progress
lean-spec update 042 --priority high
lean-spec update 042 --tags api,backend
```

### How do I recover deleted specs?

Specs are just files in git:

```bash
git log --all --full-history -- "specs/042-my-spec/*"
git checkout <commit> -- specs/042-my-spec/
```

Or restore from archived:

```bash
mv archived/042-my-spec specs/
lean-spec update 042 --status in-progress
```

### CLI command not working

**Check installation:**
```bash
which lean-spec
lean-spec --version
```

**Reinstall if needed:**
```bash
npm install -g lean-spec
```

**Verify you're in a git repo:**
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir
```
