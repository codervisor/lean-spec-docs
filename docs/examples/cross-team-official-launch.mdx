# Cross-Team Feature: Official Launch v0.2.0

:::info Example Profile
- **Spec**: [043-official-launch-02](https://web.lean-spec.dev/specs/043-official-launch-02)
- **Type**: Cross-Team Launch / Program Management
- **Complexity**: Very High (multi-spec coordination)
- **Time to complete**: ~6 weeks (with dependencies)
- **Filters**: `Cross-Team` `Program` `Release`
- **Best for**: Leads orchestrating many specs, approvals, and AI agents toward a single ship date.
:::

## Learning Objectives

- Design a meta-spec that sequences dependent specs while keeping scope small enough to ship.
- Capture launch gates so humans and agents know exactly when quality bars are met.
- Use spec relationships (`depends_on`, `related`) to communicate rollout order without meetings.

## Context

### The Problem

LeanSpec v0.1.0 was an alpha release for early validation. Now we needed to launch v0.2.0 as the **official public release**, treating v0.1.0 as internal-only.

**The challenge**: This wasn't a single feature—it was coordinating **multiple specs** across:
- Foundation work (first principles - spec 049)
- Operationalization (validation tooling - spec 018)
- Feature work (pattern selection - specs 024, 026)
- Documentation (AGENTS.md - spec 051)
- Website (live showcase - spec 035)

**Critical questions**:
- What's essential for v0.2.0 vs nice-to-have?
- How do we coordinate 5+ specs without constant meetings?
- What if we discover blockers mid-launch?
- How do we ensure quality while maintaining velocity?

### Why This Spec?

**Without this coordinating spec**:
- Individual specs work in isolation, miss dependencies
- Launch date keeps slipping ("just one more feature")
- Quality gates unclear, ship with bugs
- Team doesn't know what's in scope

**With coordinating spec**:
- Clear launch criteria and scope
- Dependencies explicit (spec 049 → spec 051 → spec 018)
- Can defer non-essential work to v0.3.0
- Everyone knows status at a glance

**This is a meta-spec** - It doesn't implement a feature, it coordinates other specs.

## The Spec

### Launch Strategy

**Three-Phase Rollout** with clear dependencies:

```
Week 1-2: Foundation
├─ Spec 049: First Principles Discovery ✅
├─ Spec 048: Complexity Analysis Tools ✅
└─ Spec 051: AGENTS.md & README Updates ⬅ depends on 049

Week 3-4: Operationalization
├─ Spec 018: Validation (complexity checks) ⬅ depends on 048
├─ Spec 024: Pattern-aware list ⬅ depends on 018
└─ Spec 026: Init pattern selection ⬅ depends on 024

Week 5-6: Launch Preparation
├─ Spec 044: Spec relationships clarity
├─ Spec 035: Live specs showcase (if ready)
└─ Marketing & documentation polish
```

### Success Criteria

**Technical Quality Gates**:
- ✅ 100% test pass rate (261/261 passing)
- ✅ Zero critical or high severity bugs
- ✅ MCP server stability (no crashes on errors)
- ⏱️ &lt;100ms CLI response time for common commands
- ✅ Documentation accuracy verified (spec 056)
- ✅ All examples tested and working (spec 056)

**User Experience Benchmarks**:
- ✅ First-time user completes tutorial in &lt;15 minutes
- ✅ AI agents can use specs without human clarification
- ✅ Philosophy understood from documentation alone

**Philosophy Alignment**:
- ✅ Operationalize first principles through tooling
- ✅ Practice what we preach (dogfooding)
- ✅ Defer major redesign to v0.3.0 (stay lean)

### Key Decision: Scope Reduction

**Original plan**: Ship everything in spec 050 (major redesign)

**Discovery**: First principles (spec 049) fundamentally reframe priorities:
- Foundation > Feature accumulation
- Operationalization > More patterns
- Quality > Velocity

**Adjusted plan**:
- ✅ Keep: Foundation work (specs 049, 051, 018)
- ✅ Keep: Essential features (specs 024, 026)
- 📅 Defer: Major redesign (spec 050) to v0.3.0
- 📅 Defer: Copilot slash commands (spec 034) to v0.3.0

**Why defer?** Stay lean, validate core value before adding complexity.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Establish philosophical foundation and operationalize through tooling.

**Key work**:

1. **Spec 049: First Principles Discovery** ✅
   - Distilled 5 first principles from 90+ specs
   - Context Economy, Signal-to-Noise, Intent Over Implementation, Bridge the Gap, Progressive Disclosure
   - Documented conflict resolution framework

2. **Spec 048: Complexity Analysis Tools** ✅
   - Implemented `lean-spec analyze` for complexity insights
   - Token counting per section
   - Split recommendations

3. **Spec 051: AGENTS.md & README Updates** ✅
   - Updated documentation to reflect first principles
   - Added principle-based decision framework
   - Improved AI agent instructions

**Coordination challenges**:
- Spec 051 blocked on spec 049 completion
- Needed principles finalized before documenting
- Used spec relationships: `related: [049]`

### Phase 2: Operationalization (Week 3-4)

**Goal**: Ship tooling that prevents principle violations.

**Key work**:

1. **Spec 018: Validation with Complexity Checks** ✅
   - Added token threshold validation
   - Integrated with `lean-spec validate`
   - CI integration for automatic checks

2. **Spec 024: Pattern-Aware List** ✅
   - Enhanced `lean-spec list` with pattern detection
   - Show which specs use which patterns
   - Help users find examples

3. **Spec 026: Init Pattern Selection** ✅
   - Interactive pattern picker in `lean-spec create`
   - Descriptions based on first principles
   - Smart defaults based on project size

**Coordination approach**:
- Weekly sync to review progress
- Specs linked via `related` field for context
- Blockers surfaced in spec Notes section

### Phase 3: Launch Preparation (Week 5-6)

**Goal**: Polish and prepare for public release.

**Key work**:

1. **Spec 044: Spec Relationships Clarity** ✅
   - Clarified `related` vs `depends_on`
   - Updated documentation with examples
   - Improved `lean-spec deps` output

2. **Spec 035: Live Specs Showcase** ⏳
   - Discovered: More complex than expected
   - Decision: Move to v0.3.0 as flagship feature
   - Rationale: Don't delay launch for non-essential feature

3. **Marketing Content** ✅
   - Emphasized first-principles philosophy
   - Created comparison guide
   - Recorded demo videos

4. **Beta Testing** ✅
   - 5 external users tested pre-release
   - Collected feedback, fixed 3 UX issues
   - Validated documentation clarity

**Critical decision point**:
- Week 5: Realized spec 035 would delay launch 2+ weeks
- Team decision: Defer to v0.3.0
- Spec 043 updated with rationale
- Communicated change to stakeholders

## Evolution

### What Changed During Implementation?

**1. Scope Discipline**

**Original mindset**: "Let's include everything we can!"

**Shift after spec 049**: "What's essential for v0.2.0 value prop?"

**Impact**:
- Deferred spec 050 (major redesign) - Too large, not essential
- Deferred spec 034 (Copilot commands) - Nice-to-have, not critical
- Moved spec 035 (live showcase) to v0.3.0 - Flagship feature for next release

**Lesson**: First principles helped us say "no" to good ideas that didn't fit v0.2.0 goals.

**2. Quality Over Speed**

**Original plan**: Ship in 4 weeks

**Reality**: Took 6 weeks, but higher quality

**Changes**:
- Added beta testing phase (not in original plan)
- Ran `lean-spec validate` on all specs, split 8 oversized ones
- Fixed all failing tests before launch (3 tests were flaky)

**Trade-off**: Delayed 2 weeks, but launched with zero critical bugs.

**3. Documentation as First-Class Work**

**Original plan**: Documentation is last

**Reality**: Documentation drives adoption

**Changes**:
- Spec 051 elevated to Phase 1 (was Phase 3)
- Added spec 056 (documentation validation) mid-launch
- Wrote comparison guide (not in original plan)

**Impact**: Users reported "best docs of any CLI tool" - Worth the time investment.

**4. Continuous Scope Re-evaluation**

**Week 2**: Discovered first principles changed priorities → Updated spec 043

**Week 4**: Realized spec 035 wouldn't finish on time → Updated spec 043

**Week 5**: Beta testing revealed 3 UX issues → Updated spec 043

**Pattern**: **Spec as living document**. Updated spec 043 when plans changed, kept team aligned.

### Challenges

**Challenge 1: Dependency Coordination**

**Problem**: Spec 051 blocked on spec 049, but spec 049 owner went on vacation.

**Solution**:
- Used `depends_on: [049]` in spec 051 frontmatter
- `lean-spec deps 051` showed blocker clearly
- Reassigned spec 049 to unblock

**Lesson**: Explicit dependencies > implicit assumptions.

**Challenge 2: Scope Creep**

**Problem**: Team kept adding "just one more thing" to v0.2.0.

**Solution**:
- Spec 043 became the "source of truth" for scope
- Changes required updating spec and getting consensus
- "Is this essential for v0.2.0?" became the test question

**Lesson**: Coordinating spec provides scope discipline.

**Challenge 3: Changing Priorities**

**Problem**: First principles discovery (spec 049) changed what "good" meant.

**Solution**:
- Updated spec 043 to reflect new priorities
- Documented rationale for changes in spec
- Team reviewed updated spec before continuing

**Lesson**: Specs enable pivots by making changes explicit.

**Challenge 4: Communication Overhead**

**Problem**: 6 people working on 8 related specs = coordination chaos.

**Solution**:
- Spec 043 as "mission control"
- Weekly async check-ins via spec updates
- `lean-spec board` showed status at a glance

**Lesson**: Specs reduce meeting overhead.

## Outcome

### Launch Metrics

**Quality** ✅:
- 261/261 tests passing (100%)

## Lessons

### What Worked

✅ **Spec as coordination tool**
   - Single source of truth for scope
   - Dependency tracking prevented bottlenecks
   - Status visible at a glance via `lean-spec board`

✅ **Explicit dependencies**
   - `depends_on` field made blockers obvious
   - `lean-spec deps <spec>` showed critical path
   - Could prioritize unblocking work

✅ **Living document approach**
   - Updated spec 043 as plans changed
   - Kept team aligned without constant meetings
   - Historical record of decisions and rationale

✅ **Scope discipline through specs**
   - "Is it in spec 043?" became the filter
   - Deferred 3 specs without drama
   - First principles helped prioritize

✅ **Three-phase structure**
   - Clear boundaries (Foundation → Ops → Polish)
   - Could validate each phase before moving on
   - Reduced risk of cascading failures

### What We'd Do Differently

🔄 **Earlier beta testing**
   - Started in Week 5, should have been Week 3
   - Would have caught UX issues earlier
   - Would have had more time to fix

🔄 **More explicit time estimates**
   - Spec 043 had phases but no time boxes
   - Made it hard to spot slippage early
   - Should have added "Week X-Y" to each phase

🔄 **Clearer deferral criteria**
   - Took until Week 5 to defer spec 035
   - Should have had "essential vs nice-to-have" from start
   - Would have reduced scope debates

🔄 **Daily status updates**
   - Used weekly updates, felt slow
   - Should have used `lean-spec update` daily
   - Would have caught blockers faster

### Key Takeaways

**1. Specs enable coordination without meetings**
   - Async communication via spec updates
   - Status visible via `lean-spec board`
   - Dependencies explicit via frontmatter

**2. Coordinating spec is different from feature spec**
   - Meta-level: Coordinates other specs
   - Living document: Updates as plans change
   - Scope discipline: Filter for what's in/out

**3. First principles enable hard decisions**
   - Helped prioritize foundation over features
   - Made deferral decisions clear (not emotional)
   - Team aligned on "why" not just "what"

**4. Quality requires scope discipline**
   - Can't have speed + quality + full scope
   - Choose 2 of 3
   - We chose quality + (full-ish) scope, sacrificed speed

**5. Specs reduce coordination overhead**
   - 4 meetings total vs typical 12+
   - Async updates instead of Slack threads
   - Clear decision record in spec history

## AI Agent Collaboration

### How AI Agents Used This Spec

**GitHub Copilot Agent**:
1. Read spec 043 to understand launch scope and priorities
2. Used `related` field to find dependent specs
3. Implemented features according to phase plan
4. Updated spec 043 status as work completed
5. Flagged when work would miss deadlines

**Challenge**: This is a **coordinating spec**, not an implementation spec. AI agents needed guidance on:
- Which spec to work on next
- When to update spec 043 with progress
- How to flag blockers

**Solution**:
- Spec 043 linked to all related specs clearly
- Each phase listed specs in priority order
- Agent worked on specs sequentially, reported back

**Agent autonomy**: 40% for coordination - Higher human involvement needed for:
- Prioritization decisions (what to defer?)
- Scope changes (when to update spec 043?)
- Quality judgments (is this ready to ship?)

**Implementation autonomy**: 75% within individual specs - Once direction was clear, agents implemented well.

### Spec Quality for Coordination

**What made coordination specs different**:

1. **Meta-level thinking** - Coordinating other specs, not implementing features
2. **Living document** - More updates during implementation than typical spec
3. **Judgment calls** - Deferral decisions required human input
4. **Relationship management** - Many `related` and `depends_on` fields

**What helped AI agents**:

1. **Explicit phases** - Clear what work happens when
2. **Success criteria** - Measurable gates for each phase
3. **Linked specs** - Easy to navigate to implementation specs
4. **Status tracking** - Could see what's blocked vs in-progress

### Human-AI Division of Labor

**Human role**:
- Strategic decisions (what to defer?)
- Priority calls (which spec to work on next?)
- Quality judgment (ready to ship?)
- Scope changes (update spec 043 when plans change)

**AI role**:
- Implement individual specs according to plan
- Flag blockers and timeline risks
- Update spec status as work completes
- Generate content (docs, tests, code)

**Result**: Human focused on coordination and strategy, AI handled implementation. Launch succeeded because roles were clear.

### Lessons for Coordinating Specs

**Do**:
- ✅ Make phases and dependencies explicit
- ✅ Link to all related specs clearly
- ✅ Update spec as plans change (living document)
- ✅ Use status tracking (`lean-spec board`)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Expect AI to make strategic decisions
- ❌ Assume AI knows what to prioritize
- ❌ Leave scope implicit
- ❌ Forget to update spec when plans change

**Key insight**: Coordinating specs need more human guidance than implementation specs. AI can execute the plan, but humans must make the strategic calls.

## Try It Yourself

Want to coordinate a complex project with specs?

1. **Create a coordinating spec** - Like spec 043, it links related specs
2. **Make dependencies explicit** - Use `depends_on` and `related` fields
3. **Define phases** - Clear boundaries, measurable milestones
4. **Use as living document** - Update as plans change
5. **Track status daily** - Use `lean-spec board` to spot blockers

**Template**: Use [spec 043](https://web.lean-spec.dev/specs/043-official-launch-02) as a template for release or project coordination.

**Key Questions**:
- What's essential vs nice-to-have?
- What are the dependencies between work items?
- What are the quality gates for each phase?
- How will we coordinate without constant meetings?

If you can answer these, you're ready to coordinate with specs.

**Remember**: Coordinating specs are different from implementation specs. They coordinate people and priorities, not just code.
