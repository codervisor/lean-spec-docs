# Real-World Examples

LeanSpec dogfoods every workflow. These examples highlight the exact specs, code paths, and AI-assisted workflows we used to ship major changes. Each link opens the canonical spec on [web.lean-spec.dev](https://web.lean-spec.dev) so you can explore the live document with syntax highlighting, navigation, and related links.

## At-a-glance Grid

| Example | Type | Complexity | Time | Why read it? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Simple Feature: Token Validation](./simple-feature-token-validation) | Feature | Simple | ~3 hours | Shows how a single-session spec applies Context Economy + validation rules. |
| [Complex Feature: Web Realtime Sync](./complex-feature-web-sync) | Architecture | Complex | ~3 weeks | Demonstrates phased delivery, sub-specs, and AI-assisted coordination. |
| [Refactor: Monorepo Core Extraction](./refactoring-monorepo-core) | Refactor | Complex | ~1 week | Walks through a breaking change plan and dependency sequencing. |
| [Cross-Team Launch](./cross-team-official-launch) | Cross-Team | Program | ~6 weeks | Covers multi-spec coordination, approvals, and rollout playbooks. |

## Filter by Need

- `Simple` — One-session improvements you can finish in a morning.
- `Complex` — Multi-phase efforts that need sub-specs and validation gates.
- `Refactor` — Breaking change patterns with guardrails.
- `Cross-Team` — Specs designed for coordination across squads and AI agents.

Filters show up near the top of every example so you can quickly match a template to your use case.

## What Each Example Includes

1. **Interactive Spec Link** — Opens the exact spec, not a GitHub blob.
2. **Profile** — Type, complexity, time-to-complete, and recommended audience.
3. **Learning Objectives** — What you should take away.
4. **Implementation Walkthrough** — Phases, files, and AI prompts we used.
5. **Evolution + Lessons** — Real adjustments we made mid-stream.

## Suggested Reading Order

1. Start with the **Simple Feature** if you are brand new to SDD.
2. Jump to the **Refactor** when you need to de-risk a large change.
3. Pick the **Complex Feature** to understand phased delivery.
4. Finish with **Cross-Team Launch** to see how specs coordinate multiple squads.
