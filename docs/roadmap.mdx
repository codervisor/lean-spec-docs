# Roadmap

LeanSpec is actively developed using AI-powered spec-driven development. Here's what's coming next—with links to the actual specs we're using to build them. (We dogfood LeanSpec!)

:::info AI-Powered Development Velocity
We're building LeanSpec with AI agents following our own spec-driven methodology. Traditional timeline estimates don't apply—features often ship weeks or months earlier than conventional development. Completed work shows actual dates; future work shows priority order, not fixed timelines.
