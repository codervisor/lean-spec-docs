# Marketing & Launch Strategy

Positioning, messaging, channels, and content strategy for v0.2.0 launch.

## Marketing Positioning

**Tagline:** "First-Principles Spec-Driven Development for AI-powered teams"

### Key Messages
1. **First Principles Foundation** - Built on 5 immutable constraints (physics, biology, economics)
2. **Operationalized Philosophy** - Tools that enforce principles, not just document them
3. **AI-native** - Built for human + AI collaboration from the ground up
4. **Practice what we preach** - Dogfooded extensively, specs demonstrate principles

### Differentiation
- **vs Traditional SDD**: We optimize for context windows and token costs (first principles, not convention)
- **vs Agile**: We capture intent for AI execution (Bridge the Gap principle)
- **vs "No docs"**: We document what matters (Signal-to-Noise principle)
- **vs Heavyweight tools**: We stay lean by design (Context Economy principle)

### Target Audience (Priority Order)
1. Solo developers using Cursor/Copilot/Claude (need lightweight SDD)
2. Small teams (2-5 devs) adopting AI pair programming
3. Startups scaling from solo to team (Progressive Disclosure)
4. Engineering teams frustrated with heavyweight SDD
5. First-principles thinkers curious about principled design

## Messaging Framework

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"LeanSpec is spec-driven development for AI-powered teams. We enforce first principles like Context Economy and Signal-to-Noise through tooling, not just documentation. Specs stay under 400 lines, fit in context windows, and work seamlessly with AI coding agents."

### Problem Statement
"Traditional documentation is either too heavyweight (loses signal in noise) or nonexistent (AI can't understand intent). LeanSpec finds the middle ground: minimal, structured specs optimized for both human and AI consumption."

### Solution Overview
"Five first principles guide every decision: Context Economy, Signal-to-Noise, Intent Over Implementation, Bridge the Gap, and Progressive Disclosure. We operationalize these through validation, complexity analysis, and pattern detection."

### Call to Action
"Install in 30 seconds: `npm install -g lean-spec`. Create your first spec in 5 minutes. Let the tooling enforce good practices."

## Community Building

### GitHub Setup
- [ ] Set up GitHub Discussions
- [ ] Create issue templates (bug, feature, question)
- [ ] Enhance CONTRIBUTING.md with first principles guidance
- [ ] Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for community management

### FAQ Content
**"Why <400 lines?"**
- Context windows (AI), working memory (humans), token costs (economics)

**"Isn't this too restrictive?"**
- Use sub-specs for complex features. Constraint breeds clarity.

**"How is this different from Agile/Lean?"**
- Optimized for AI execution, not just human communication

**"Can I use custom fields?"**
- Yes! Progressive Disclosure: add when you need them

### Support Strategy
- Respond to issues within 24 hours
- Weekly community highlights in Discussions
- Monthly office hours / AMA sessions
- Recognize contributors in CHANGELOG
