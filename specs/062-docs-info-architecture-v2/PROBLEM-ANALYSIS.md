# Problem Analysis

## Current Structure Issues

**Core Concepts Section** (Currently mixing WHY and HOW):
```
Core Concepts/
  - Understanding LeanSpec (5 principles + mental models + mindset + beliefs - TOO MUCH)
  - Writing Specs AI Can Execute (This is HOW, not core concept)
  - When to Use (This is HOW - decision framework)
```

**Working with AI Section** (Redundant and misplaced):
```
Working with AI/
  - index, setup, agents-md, best-practices, examples
  - Overlaps with Getting Started
  - Mixes foundational setup with advanced tips
```

**Features vs Workflow** (Artificial separation):
```
Features/ (templates, frontmatter, custom-fields, variables)
Workflow/ (board-stats, dependencies, validation)
```
- Both are "how to use LeanSpec features"
- Split creates confusion about where to find things
- Missing basic commands (create, update, list, search)

## User Confusion Points

1. **What IS LeanSpec fundamentally?** (positioning/philosophy buried in verbose content)
2. **Why should I use it?** (positioning not clear upfront)
3. **How do I get started?** (split between Getting Started and Working with AI)
4. **How do I use basic commands?** (not clearly documented)
5. **What are advanced features?** (scattered across Features and Workflow)
