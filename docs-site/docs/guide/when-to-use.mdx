# When to Use LeanSpec

LeanSpec is a powerful methodology, but it's not always the right tool for every situation. This guide helps you decide when to use LeanSpec and when to look elsewhere.

## Perfect for LeanSpec

### ✅ New Features or Components

**When:**
- Building a new feature from scratch
- Adding a significant component to existing system
- Need to align team on approach

**Why it works:**
- Captures intent before diving into code
- Reduces rework from misunderstandings
- Provides clear direction for implementation

**Example:** Adding user authentication to your app

### ✅ API Designs

**When:**
- Designing new APIs or endpoints
- Changing existing API contracts
- Need to coordinate frontend/backend teams

**Why it works:**
- Documents contracts clearly
- Prevents integration issues
- Easy to reference during development

**Example:** REST API for user management

### ✅ Architecture Decisions

**When:**
- Choosing between architectural approaches
- Making decisions that affect multiple teams
- Need shared understanding of system design

**Why it works:**
- Makes trade-offs explicit
- Creates shared context
- Documents rationale for future reference

**Example:** Choosing microservices vs. monolith

### ✅ Quick Alignment

**When:**
- Need fast consensus on direction
- Want to avoid lengthy meetings
- Multiple stakeholders need to understand

**Why it works:**
- Faster than meetings or long documents
- Everyone reads the same thing
- Easy to iterate and refine

**Example:** Sprint planning for new feature

### ✅ AI-Powered Development

**When:**
- Working with AI coding agents
- Need clear context for AI implementation
- Want AI to understand requirements

**Why it works:**
- AI agents parse specs effectively
- Reduces misinterpretation
- Specs guide AI to correct solutions

**Example:** Having GitHub Copilot implement a feature

### ✅ Cross-Team Coordination

**When:**
- Features span multiple teams
- Need to coordinate timing and interfaces
- Want to avoid integration problems

**Why it works:**
- Single source of truth
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Explicit dependencies

**Example:** Feature requiring mobile, backend, and ops changes

## Not Ideal for LeanSpec

### ❌ Detailed API Reference Documentation

**What to use instead:** Code comments + auto-generated docs (Swagger, JSDoc, etc.)

**Why:**
- Reference docs need to be comprehensive
- Generated docs stay in sync with code
- LeanSpec is for design, not reference

**Example:** Complete API documentation for 50 endpoints

### ❌ Step-by-Step User Manuals

**What to use instead:** Dedicated user documentation tools

**Why:**
- User docs require different audience and format
- Screenshots, videos, interactive tutorials
- LeanSpec is for development teams, not end users

**Example:** How to configure software settings

### ❌ Compliance Requirements with Specific Formats

**What to use instead:** Whatever format compliance demands

**Why:**
- Compliance is non-negotiable
- Required formats may not be lean
- Use LeanSpec internally, compliance docs externally

**Example:** SOC 2 audit documentation

### ❌ Trivial Bug Fixes

**What to use instead:** Just fix it and commit

**Why:**
- Overhead exceeds value
- Code change is self-documenting
- Creating spec wastes time

**Example:** Fixing typo in error message

### ❌ Experimental Prototypes

**What to use instead:** Code first, document if it works

**Why:**
- High uncertainty, likely to throw away
- Learning by doing is faster
- Spec becomes outdated immediately

**Example:** Testing feasibility of new algorithm

### ❌ Obvious Refactors

**What to use instead:** Make the change with good commit messages

**Why:**
- Intent is clear from the change itself
- No ambiguity about what needs to happen
- Spec adds no value

**Example:** Renaming variables for clarity

## Decision Framework

Still not sure? Use this decision tree:

```
Is this a significant change affecting multiple parts of the system?
├─ No → Skip LeanSpec, just do it
└─ Yes → Continue

Will this require coordination between multiple people?
├─ No → Consider if spec would help future you
└─ Yes → Continue

Is there ambiguity about requirements or approach?
├─ No → Maybe skip, or write brief spec
└─ Yes → Definitely use LeanSpec

Are you working with AI coding agents?
├─ Yes → Use LeanSpec for clear context
└─ No → Continue

Would writing this take more than 15 minutes?
├─ Yes → Reconsider if it's truly lean
└─ No → Write the spec!
```

## Start Lean, Add More if Needed

When in doubt, start minimal and add detail only if needed:

**Phase 1: Minimal Spec (5-10 minutes)**
- What problem are we solving?
- What are the key scenarios?
- What does "done" look like?

If that's enough, stop there.

**Phase 2: Add Technical Details (if needed)**
- What's the technical approach?
- What are the constraints?
- What are the dependencies?

**Phase 3: Add Coordination Details (if needed)**
- Who owns what?
- What's the timeline?
- What are the milestones?

Don't write Phase 2 if Phase 1 is sufficient. Don't write Phase 3 if Phases 1-2 are sufficient.

## Team Considerations

### Solo Developers

- Use for features you'll forget about in a month
- Use to document decisions for future you
- Skip for obvious changes

### Small Teams (2-5 people)

- Use for features spanning multiple people
- Use when alignment is needed
- Skip when everyone knows what to do

### Large Teams (>5 people)

- Use for most significant features
- Use for cross-team coordination
- Skip only for truly trivial changes

### Enterprise Organizations

- Use for features affecting multiple teams
- Use for architectural decisions
- Use for compliance-adjacent work (but not the compliance docs themselves)
- Template heavily to reduce overhead

## When It Feels Like Too Much

If writing specs feels burdensome:

1. **Make them shorter** - Cut everything that doesn't add clarity
2. **Use templates** - Pre-fill common sections
3. **Time-box it** - Spend max 30 minutes on a spec
4. **Raise the bar** - Only spec bigger features
5. **Get AI help** - Have AI draft initial specs

The goal is **reduced burden**, not added process.

## Success Stories

### When It Works Well

"We spent 20 minutes on a spec, saved 3 days of rework." - Startup CTO

"AI agents implement features correctly the first time now." - Solo dev

"No more confusion about what we're building." - Team lead

### When It Doesn't Work

"Specs became 10-page documents nobody read." - Solution: Make them shorter

"We spec everything, even typo fixes." - Solution: Raise the bar

"Specs are outdated as soon as we write them." - Solution: Update as you go

## The Bottom Line

LeanSpec is most valuable when:
- There's meaningful complexity or ambiguity
- Multiple people need to be aligned
- You're working with AI agents
- The cost of misunderstanding is high

Skip LeanSpec when:
- The change is trivial or obvious
- You're the only person involved
- The work is exploratory or experimental
- Compliance requires a specific format

**When in doubt, err on the side of lean.**
