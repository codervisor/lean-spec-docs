# Board & Stats

Get instant visibility into your project's health with LeanSpec's board and stats commands.

## Board Command

Visual kanban view of your specs:

```bash
lspec board
```

Shows specs organized by status columns:
- 📋 **Planned** - Specs ready to start
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Active work
- ✅ **Complete** - Finished specs

### Project Health Summary

The board includes a project health summary:
- Total specs count
- Distribution by status
- Recent activity
- Blocked specs (waiting on dependencies)

### Filtering

Filter the board view:

```bash
# Show only high priority specs
lspec board --priority high

# Show specs with specific tag
lspec board --tag feature

# Combine filters
lspec board --priority high --tag api
```

## Stats Command

Quick project metrics:

```bash
lspec stats
```

Shows:
- Total specs count
- Status breakdown (planned, in-progress, complete)
- Priority distribution
- Most common tags
- Recent activity summary

### Full Analytics

Get detailed analytics:

```bash
lspec stats --full
```

Provides comprehensive project insights:
- Detailed status metrics
- Priority breakdown
- Tag frequency analysis
- Completion trends
- Average time in each status
- Health indicators

## Workflows

### Daily Standup

```bash
# Quick project overview
lspec board

# See what's in progress
lspec board --status in-progress

# Check high priority items
lspec board --priority high
```

### Sprint Planning

```bash
# Review project health
lspec stats --full

# See what's ready to start
lspec board --status planned

# Check capacity
lspec stats
```

### Weekly Review

```bash
# Overall project metrics
lspec stats --full

# Review completed work
lspec board --status complete

# Identify bottlenecks
lspec board --status in-progress
```

## Project Health Indicators

The board and stats commands help identify:

### ⚠️ Warning Signs
- Too many in-progress specs (focus issues)
- Old specs without updates (stale work)
- High percentage of planned specs (execution gap)
- Specs blocked by dependencies

### ✅ Healthy Signals
- Steady completion rate
- Balanced status distribution
- Active recent updates
- Clear priority focus

## Best Practices

1. **Check daily** - Start your day with `lspec board`
2. **Review weekly** - Use `lspec stats --full` for trends
3. **Limit WIP** - Keep in-progress specs under control
4. **Update regularly** - Keep status current with `lspec update`
5. **Use priorities** - Focus on high-priority work first

## Tips

- Use `lspec board` for visual overview
- Use `lspec stats` for quick metrics
- Combine with `lspec deps` to understand dependencies
- Export stats for reporting (pipe to file or tools)
- Use filtering to focus on specific areas
