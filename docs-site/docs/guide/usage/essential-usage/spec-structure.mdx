# Spec Structure

Understand the anatomy of a LeanSpec spec: frontmatter, required sections, sub-spec files, and how to structure specs for both human and AI understanding.

## Spec Anatomy

Every spec consists of:
1. **Frontmatter** (YAML metadata)
2. **Title and Status Badge** (auto-generated)
3. **Core Sections** (Problem, Solution, Success Criteria)
4. **Optional Sub-Spec Files** (for complex specs)

## Frontmatter

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
status: planned                    # Current status
created: '2025-11-08'             # Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
created_at: '2025-11-08T10:30:00Z' # ISO timestamp (auto-managed)
updated_at: '2025-11-08T14:45:00Z' # ISO timestamp (auto-managed)
---
```

**Important**: These are system-managed. Use `lspec update` to modify, never edit manually.

### Optional Fields

```yaml
---
status: in-progress
created: '2025-11-08'
tags:                              # Categorization
  - api
  - backend
  - security
priority: high                     # high, medium, low
assignee: alice                    # Who's working on it
depends_on:                        # Hard dependencies (blocking)
  - spec-041
  - spec-039
related:                           # Soft relationships (informational)
  - spec-043
  - spec-044
created_at: '2025-11-08T10:30:00Z'
updated_at: '2025-11-08T14:45:00Z'
completed_at: '2025-11-09T16:20:00Z'  # When marked complete
transitions:                       # Status change history
  - status: in-progress
    at: '2025-11-08T11:00:00Z'
  - status: complete
    at: '2025-11-09T16:20:00Z'
---
```

**Manual editing**: Only `depends_on` and `related` must be edited manually (no CLI command yet). All others use `lspec update`.

**See also**: [Frontmatter Reference](/docs/reference/frontmatter)

## Status Badge

Auto-generated after frontmatter:

```markdown
> **Status**: ⏳ In progress · **Priority**: High · **Created**: 2025-11-08 · **Tags**: api, backend
```

This is rendered by the CLI and shouldn't be manually edited.

## Core Sections

### Minimal Structure

Every spec should have at minimum:

```markdown
## Problem
[What problem are we solving? Why does it matter?]

## Solution
[What are we building? How does it solve the problem?]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [How do we know it's done?]
- [ ] [What does success look like?]
```

### Recommended Structure

For more complex specs:

```markdown
## Overview
[1-2 paragraph summary of the feature/change]

## Problem
[Detailed problem description]

### Why It Matters
[Impact, urgency, business context]

### Current State
[What exists today that's insufficient]

## Solution
[Proposed approach]

### Design Decisions
[Key choices made and why]

### Trade-offs
[What we're giving up, alternatives considered]

## Implementation
[High-level implementation approach]

### Phases (if multi-phase)
1. Phase 1: [Description]
2. Phase 2: [Description]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific, measurable outcomes]
- [ ] [Acceptance criteria]
- [ ] [Performance targets]

## Out of Scope
- [What we're explicitly NOT doing]
- [Future considerations]
```

### Optional Sections

Add only if needed:

```markdown
## Research
[Findings from exploration/spikes]

## Dependencies
[External dependencies, blocked work]

## Testing Strategy
[How to validate the solution]

## Rollout Plan
[Deployment approach, migration steps]

## Risks
[Potential issues and mitigations]
```

## Sub-Spec Files

When a spec exceeds 400 lines or has multiple distinct concerns, split into sub-specs:

### Common Sub-Specs

```
specs/042-my-feature/
├── README.md              # Main spec (required)
├── DESIGN.md              # Detailed design and architecture
├── IMPLEMENTATION.md      # Implementation plan with phases
├── TESTING.md             # Test strategy and test cases
├── CONFIGURATION.md       # Config examples and schemas
└── API.md                 # API design (if applicable)
```

### README.md (Main Spec)

Should contain:
- Frontmatter (metadata)
- High-level overview
- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Success criteria
- Links to sub-specs for details

**Target**: &lt;300 lines

### DESIGN.md

Detailed design decisions:
- Architecture diagrams
- Data models
- Component interactions
- Technology choices and rationale

**Target**: &lt;400 lines

### IMPLEMENTATION.md

Execution plan:
- Phase breakdown
- Task lists
- Order of operations
- Integration points

**Target**: &lt;400 lines

### TESTING.md

Test strategy:
- Test cases
- Edge cases
- Performance tests
- Integration tests

**Target**: &lt;400 lines

## Examples

### Simple Spec (Single File)

```markdown
---
status: planned
created: '2025-11-08'
tags:
  - bug-fix
priority: medium
---

# Fix Authentication Timeout

> **Status**: 📋 Planned · **Priority**: Medium

## Problem
Users are logged out after 15 minutes of inactivity, even if actively using the app. Session timeout is too aggressive.

## Solution
Extend session timeout to 8 hours for active users:
- Keep 15-minute timeout for truly inactive users
- Refresh session on any API call
- Add "Remember me" option for 30-day token

## Implementation
1. Update JWT token TTL configuration
2. Add middleware to refresh token on API calls
3. Add "Remember me" checkbox to login form
4. Update documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users stay logged in for 8 hours of active use
- [ ] Inactive users (no API calls) timeout after 15 minutes
- [ ] "Remember me" tokens last 30 days
- [ ] Zero customer complaints about premature logouts

## Out of Scope
- SSO integration (future work)
- Multi-device session management
```

**Line count**: ~45 lines ✅

### Complex Spec (Multi-File)

**README.md** (overview):
```markdown
---
status: in-progress
created: '2025-11-08'
tags:
  - api
  - breaking-change
priority: high
depends_on:
  - spec-041

# API v2 Redesign

> **Status**: ⏳ In progress · **Priority**: High

## Overview
Complete redesign of REST API to RESTful principles, consistent error handling, and improved performance.

## Problem
Current API (v1) has:
- Inconsistent endpoint naming
- Mixed HTTP methods (some resources use POST for reads)
- No standard error format
- Poor performance (N+1 queries common)

See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for detailed analysis.

## Solution
Build API v2 with:
- RESTful resource design
- Consistent error responses
- GraphQL for complex queries
- &lt;200ms p95 response time

See:
- [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) - Architecture and design decisions
- [IMPLEMENTATION.md](./IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Phase breakdown
- [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) - Test strategy

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All v1 endpoints have v2 equivalents
- [ ] p95 response time &lt;200ms
- [ ] 100% API test coverage
- [ ] Migration guide published
- [ ] Zero breaking changes for 3 months after v2 launch

## Out of Scope
- GraphQL subscriptions (v2.1)
- Batch operations (v2.2)
```

**DESIGN.md** (detailed design - 350 lines)  
**IMPLEMENTATION.md** (execution plan - 280 lines)  
**TESTING.md** (test strategy - 190 lines)  

**Total**: ~820 lines across 4 files ✅  
**Largest file**: 350 lines ✅

## Structure Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Start with Problem, Solution, Success Criteria (minimum viable)
- ✅ Add sections progressively as needed
- ✅ Split into sub-specs when >400 lines
- ✅ Link between sub-specs for navigation
- ✅ Keep README.md as entry point/overview

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Add every possible section upfront
- ❌ Let any single file exceed 400 lines
- ❌ Bury the problem statement
- ❌ Skip success criteria
- ❌ Mix multiple unrelated concerns in one spec

## AI-Friendly Structure

To maximize AI agent understanding:

**1. Use clear headings**
```markdown
## Problem
## Solution
## Success Criteria
```
Not: "The Problem", "Our Solution", "How We Know It Works"

**2. Include examples**
```markdown
## Solution
Use Redis for caching:

```json
{
  "key": "user:123",
  "value": {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
  "ttl": 300
}
```
```

**3. Make boundaries explicit**
```markdown
## Out of Scope
- Mobile app parity (future)
- OAuth providers beyond Google (not needed)
```

**4. Define success quantitatively**
```markdown
## Success Criteria
- [ ] API response time &lt;100ms (p95)
- [ ] Cache hit rate >80%
- [ ] Zero false positives in 2 weeks
```

Not: "Fast API", "Good caching", "Works well"
