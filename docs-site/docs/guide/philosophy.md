# Philosophy

> "The best spec is the one that gets read, understood, and acted upon—by humans and AI alike."

LeanSpec is a **mindset and methodology**—not just a format or tool. It embraces agile thinking: start small, iterate based on feedback, and focus on outcomes over outputs.

## The Core Philosophy

A one-page spec that everyone (including AI coding agents) understands beats a fifty-page document that nobody reads.

LeanSpec is built on four foundational beliefs:

### 1. Documentation is a Means, Not an End

The goal isn't to create comprehensive documentation. The goal is to **enable effective action**.

- Specs exist to facilitate understanding and decision-making
- If nobody reads or uses a spec, it has failed—regardless of how thorough it is
- Value delivered to users > documentation completeness

### 2. Context Beats Comprehensiveness

Capturing **why** something matters is more valuable than exhaustively documenting **what** it is.

- Understanding the problem is more important than detailing the solution
- The "why" rarely changes, but the "how" evolves constantly
- Context enables good decisions; exhaustive details become outdated quickly

### 3. Specs Should Reduce Burden, Not Create It

Traditional specs often become a burden:
- Too long to read
- Too complex to maintain
- Too rigid to adapt
- Too formal to encourage participation

LeanSpec specs should:
- Take minutes to read
- Be easy to keep current
- Evolve with the project
- Invite collaboration

### 4. AI Changes Everything

In the era of AI-assisted development, specs serve a dual purpose:
- **Human Communication**: Align team understanding
- **AI Context**: Provide clear direction for AI coding agents

AI agents benefit from the same qualities humans do:
- Clear, concise writing
- Concrete examples
- Explicit boundaries
- Testable criteria

## Principles Over Process

LeanSpec is about **principles over process**—adapt it to your team, your tools, and your context.

There is no "correct" LeanSpec format. The methodology is flexible by design. What matters is:

1. **Clarity**: Can someone (human or AI) understand what needs to be done?
2. **Focus**: Does the spec capture what matters without getting lost in details?
3. **Actionability**: Can work begin immediately after reading the spec?
4. **Adaptability**: Can the spec evolve as understanding grows?

If your spec achieves these goals, it's a good LeanSpec—regardless of its exact structure.

## The LeanSpec Mindset

To practice LeanSpec effectively, adopt these mental models:

### Start with Why

Every spec should answer: "Why does this work exist?"

- What problem are we solving?
- Why is it important?
- Why now?

Without clear answers, the work may not be worth doing.

### Embrace "Good Enough"

Perfectionism is the enemy of lean specifications.

- Ship a "good enough" spec quickly
- Get feedback from real work
- Refine based on what you learn
- Iterate continuously

A perfect spec that's never written is worthless. An imperfect spec that gets work moving is valuable.

### Question Every Word

Before writing anything, ask: "Does this add clarity?"

If not, don't write it.

- Verbose explanations → brief, clear statements
- Exhaustive edge cases → critical scenarios only
- Academic formality → conversational clarity
- Comprehensive references → essential links

### Think Living Document

Specs are not contracts carved in stone. They're living guides that evolve.

- Update specs as you learn
- Capture decisions as you make them
- Reflect reality, not just plans
- Archive when work is complete

A spec that's out of date is worse than no spec at all.

### Design for Scanning

People (and AI agents) scan before they read.

Structure specs for quick comprehension:
- Use clear headings
- Keep sections short
- Use bullet points
- Highlight key information
- Add visual elements (emojis, badges) where helpful

If someone can't understand your spec in 2 minutes, it's probably too long.

## Balancing Lean and Complete

The goal isn't to write as little as possible. The goal is to write as much as necessary.

Some features are complex and require detailed specs. That's okay. The question isn't "How short can I make this?" but rather "What's essential for understanding?"

### When to Add More Detail

Add detail when:
- Complexity demands it
- Ambiguity would cause problems
- Coordination across teams is needed
- Technical constraints are critical
- Failure has high consequences

### When to Cut Detail

Cut detail when:
- It's obvious to your audience
- It's easily discovered elsewhere
- It might change before work begins
- It's tangential to the core goal
- It's implementation detail for later

## Success Criteria

How do you know if you're practicing LeanSpec effectively?

Your specs are successful if:

✅ **They get read** - People actually read them (all the way through)  
✅ **They get used** - They inform actual development work  
✅ **They stay current** - They're updated as the project evolves  
✅ **They enable autonomy** - Developers can work without constant clarification  
✅ **They facilitate AI** - AI agents can implement features from them  
✅ **They age well** - They remain useful even after implementation

Your specs are failing if:

❌ People say "TL;DR" (too long; didn't read)  
❌ Developers ignore them and ask for clarification  
❌ They become outdated quickly  
❌ They generate more questions than answers  
❌ AI agents misinterpret them  
❌ They're never referenced after initial review

## For AI-Powered Development

When working with AI-powered development teams, LeanSpec becomes an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that integrates with:

- **System prompts** (like `AGENTS.md`)
- **Context engineering** (repository structure, naming conventions)
- **Agent instructions** (how to interpret and apply specs)

The methodology provides a framework for AI agents to:
1. Understand project context quickly
2. Know what needs to be built
3. Recognize boundaries and constraints
4. Generate appropriate code
5. Update specs as work progresses

## The Bottom Line

LeanSpec is a mindset, not a format.

Focus on:
- Why over what
- Clarity over completeness
- Action over documentation
- Evolution over perfection

If your specs help people (and AI agents) build better software faster, you're doing LeanSpec right.
