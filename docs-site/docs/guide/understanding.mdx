# Understanding LeanSpec

> "The best spec is the one that gets read, understood, and acted upon—by humans and AI alike."

LeanSpec is a **mindset and methodology** for writing specifications that actually get used in AI-powered development. It's built on immutable constraints (physics, biology, economics) and designed to bridge human intent with machine execution.

## What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is:
- **A constraint-based methodology** for writing specs that fit in working memory
- **A bridge** between human intent and AI agent execution
- **A context engineering practice** for managing AI working memory
- **A persistent memory layer** for AI agents across sessions
- **An agile approach** to specification: start small, iterate, focus on outcomes

LeanSpec provides:
- CLI tooling for creating and managing specs
- Structured frontmatter for project management (status, tags, dependencies)
- MCP server integration for AI agent access
- Sub-spec files for managing complexity
- Validation and project health tracking

## The Problem LeanSpec Solves

### Traditional Specs Fail

Traditional specifications fail for predictable reasons:
- **Too long** → Nobody reads them (violates working memory limits)
- **Too detailed** → They become outdated quickly (maintenance burden)
- **Too rigid** → They can't adapt as understanding grows (premature structure)
- **Too formal** → They discourage collaboration (friction over value)

These aren't process failures—they're **constraint violations**. 

### The AI-Powered Development Gap

In AI-assisted development, a new challenge emerges:
- **Human thinks in goals and context** ("Make the dashboard fast")
- **AI needs clear, unambiguous instructions** ("Cache with Redis, <100ms p95")
- **The gap must be bridged** or AI hallucinates, misunderstands, or asks repeatedly

**Traditional documentation doesn't bridge this gap** because it's either:
- Too vague for AI execution (high-level strategy docs)
- Too detailed for human reading (comprehensive API references)
- Not structured for AI retrieval (prose without examples/criteria)

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Why not just use tickets/issues?**
- Too brief for complex features (no rationale, constraints, or trade-offs)
- No persistent memory for AI agents (each session starts fresh)
- Hard to maintain context across multiple issues

**Why not comprehensive documentation?**
- Too long to fit in AI context windows (>10k lines common)
- Too formal and exhaustive (violates Signal-to-Noise)
- Maintenance burden scales with size (becomes outdated)

**Why not just chat with AI?**
- Context is ephemeral (lost between sessions)
- No persistent record of decisions
- Can't scale to team collaboration
- Requires re-explaining context repeatedly

## The LeanSpec Solution

LeanSpec works because it aligns with how humans and AI actually work:

### 1. Respects Fundamental Constraints

Based on three immutable constraints:
- **Physics**: Context windows are limited (even with 1M+ tokens)
- **Biology**: Working memory is small (~7 items, 5-10 min attention)
- **Economics**: Time and tokens cost money

→ **Context Economy**: Specs must fit in working memory (<400 lines)

### 2. Bridges Human and AI Understanding

Specs written for both audiences:
- **For humans**: Clear problem, rationale, trade-offs (why it matters)
- **For AI**: Structured requirements, examples, success criteria (what to build)
- **Both get**: Natural language + structured data they can parse

→ **Bridge the Gap**: Align human intent with machine execution

### 3. Serves as Persistent Memory

Specs function as semantic memory for AI agents:
- Decisions and rationale persist across sessions
- MCP server enables reliable retrieval
- Cross-references create knowledge graph
- Updates keep memory current

→ **AI Agent Memory**: Context that survives beyond chat sessions

### 4. Applies Context Engineering

Manages AI working memory proactively:
- Partition (split into sub-specs when >400 lines)
- Compact (remove redundancy)
- Compress (summarize completed phases)
- Isolate (separate unrelated concerns)

→ **Context Engineering**: Prevent context failures before they happen

### 5. Embraces Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, add structure only when pain is felt:
- Solo dev: Just status + created date
- Small team: Add tags, priority
- Enterprise: Add assignee, epic, sprint

→ **Progressive Disclosure**: No premature abstraction

## When to Use LeanSpec

LeanSpec is designed for **AI-powered SDD (Spec-Driven Development)**. Write a spec when it helps **bridge human intent to machine execution**. Skip it when the gap is already clear.

### Write a Spec When...

**🎯 Intent needs clarification:**
- Multiple valid interpretations exist
- Trade-offs or constraints aren't obvious
- "Why" matters as much as "what"
- Decisions need to be documented

**🤖 AI will implement:**
- AI agent needs executable context
- Success criteria must be explicit
- Constraints aren't inferable from code
- Implementation paths need to be narrowed

**🏗️ Work is significant:**
- Touches multiple parts of the system
- Architectural or structural changes
- Breaking changes or major refactors
- Cross-system dependencies

**📚 Knowledge needs capture:**
- Research findings and trade-offs
- Technical exploration or experiments
- Retrospectives (what worked, what didn't)
- Decisions for future reference

**Examples:**
- New feature with AI implementation
- API design affecting multiple consumers
- Architecture decision (microservices vs monolith)
- Significant refactoring (not trivial renames)
- Research spike documenting findings

### Skip the Spec When...

**✂️ Intent is self-evident:**
- Obvious bug fixes (clear cause, clear fix)
- Trivial refactoring (rename, extract function, format)
- Well-documented in code/comments already
- Change is purely mechanical

**🔬 Work is exploratory:**
- Rapid prototyping to discover requirements
- Experimenting with multiple approaches
- High uncertainty, likely to throw away
- Learning by doing is faster

*Note: Write a spec after prototyping to capture learnings*

**📄 Wrong tool for the job:**
- API reference docs (use auto-generated docs)
- User manuals (use dedicated tools)
- Compliance docs with specific formats (use required format)
- Dependency updates (standard version bumps)

**Examples:**
- One-line bug fix
- Simple rename or code formatting
- Standard dependency version bump
- Experimental prototype (document after if it works)

### The Core Question

> "Will a spec help bridge human intent to machine execution, or is the gap already clear?"

**If yes** → Write it (keep it <300 lines)  
**If no** → Skip it or use code/comments

Apply [First Principles](/docs/guide/first-principles) to guide judgment.

## How LeanSpec Works in Practice

### The SDD Workflow

1. **Discover** - Check existing specs with `lspec list`
2. **Plan** - Create spec with `lspec create <name>` when needed
3. **Implement** - Write code, keep spec in sync as you learn
4. **Update** - Mark progress with `lspec update <spec> --status <status>`
5. **Complete** - Mark complete when done, archive if finished

### For Solo Development
- Start minimal (just status + created date)
- Add structure as needs emerge
- Use specs for complex features you'll forget
- Let AI agents implement from specs

### For Team Development
- Specs provide shared understanding
- Dependencies track coordination needs
- Board view shows project health
- MCP enables AI collaboration across team

### For AI-Powered Development

Specs serve dual purposes:
- **Human-AI bridge**: Translate intent into executable context
- **AI memory**: Persist decisions and rationale across sessions

**AI can help write specs:**
- Human provides intent, constraints, success criteria
- AI drafts structure, examples, formatting
- Human refines for clarity and lean principles

**AI implements from specs:**
- Clear requirements reduce hallucination
- Examples show expected patterns
- Success criteria define "done"
- Constraints prevent wrong paths

## The Bottom Line

**LeanSpec is a mindset**, not a format.

It works because it aligns with reality:
- Context windows are limited (physics)
- Working memory is small (biology)
- Time costs money (economics)

Focus on:
- **Why** over what
- **Clarity** over completeness
- **Action** over documentation
- **Evolution** over perfection

**Success metric**: If your specs help people (and AI agents) build better software faster, you're doing LeanSpec right.
