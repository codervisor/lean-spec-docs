# Roadmap

LeanSpec is actively developed. Here's what's coming next—with links to the actual specs we're using to build them. (We dogfood LeanSpec!)

## In Development (v0.2.0)

**Official Launch** - Establishing LeanSpec as production-ready
- Rock-solid stability and comprehensive documentation
- Practice what we preach: demonstrate first principles through implementation
- Operationalize principles with validation and complexity checks
- [View spec 043](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/043-official-launch-02)

## Planned Near-Term (v0.3.0)

**Programmatic Spec Management** - Context engineering through automation
- Programmatic tools to split, compact, and transform specs
- 100x faster than manual LLM text generation
- AST-based transformations with human-in-the-loop workflow
- Apply context engineering principles at scale
- [View spec 059](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/059-programmatic-spec-management)

**VS Code Extension** - Native IDE integration
- Inline spec management without leaving your editor
- Tree view with status indicators and quick actions
- Frontmatter validation and autocomplete
- Integration with GitHub Copilot context
- [View spec 017](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/017-vscode-extension)

**GitHub Action** - Automate spec workflows in CI/CD
- Validate specs in pull requests
- Block PRs if planned specs aren't complete
- Auto-generate spec summaries in PR comments
- Track spec completion metrics over time
- [View spec 016](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/016-github-action)

**Copilot Chat Integration** - Interact with specs through AI chat
- Chat participant for natural language spec operations
- Context-aware spec suggestions during development
- Seamless AI-powered spec management
- [View spec 034](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/034-copilot-slash-commands)

**Live Specs Showcase** - Dogfooding transparency
- Embedded specs browser on documentation site
- Kanban board and stats dashboard
- Demonstrate LeanSpec in action
- [View spec 035](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/035-live-specs-showcase)

## Planned Long-Term (v0.4.0+)

**PM System Integrations** - Connect with existing workflows
- Bidirectional sync with GitHub Issues, Jira, and Azure DevOps
- LeanSpec as source of truth for specs, PM systems for tracking
- Maintain existing workflows while adding spec-driven clarity
- [View spec 036](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/tree/main/specs/036-pm-integrations)

## Completed

**v0.2.0** - Production-Ready Release
- First principles foundation and documentation
- Spec validation with complexity analysis
- Context economy enforcement (\<400 lines)
- Unified dashboard (board + stats)
- Git-based timestamp backfilling
- Branding and comprehensive docs
- Migration guide from existing tools

**v0.1.0** - Alpha Release
- Core CLI with spec management
- MCP server for AI integration
- Templates and custom fields
- Pattern-aware list grouping
- Relationship tracking
