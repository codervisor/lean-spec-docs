# AGENTS.md Template

Complete template for AI agent integration.

## Overview

`AGENTS.md` serves as permanent instructions for AI coding agents in your repository. When you run `lspec init`, this file is created or updated with LeanSpec guidance.

## Complete Template

```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

## Project: [Your Project Name]

[Brief description of what the project does]

## Core Rules

1. **Read README.md first** - Understand project context
2. **Check specs/** - Review existing specs before starting
3. **Follow LeanSpec principles** - Clarity over documentation
4. **Keep it minimal** - If it doesn't add clarity, cut it

## When to Use Specs

- Features that affect multiple parts of the system
- Breaking changes or significant refactors
- Design decisions that need team alignment
- Complex features that benefit from upfront thinking

Skip specs for:
- Bug fixes
- Trivial changes
- Self-explanatory refactors

## Discovery Commands

Before starting work, understand project context:

- \`lspec stats\` - See work distribution across specs
- \`lspec board\` - View specs organized by status
- \`lspec list --tag=<tag>\` - Find specs by tag
- \`lspec search "<query>"\` - Full-text search across specs
- \`lspec deps <spec>\` - Check dependencies before starting work

## Spec Frontmatter

When creating or updating specs, include YAML frontmatter:

\`\`\`yaml
---
status: planned|in-progress|complete|archived
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2]  # optional
priority: low|medium|high|critical  # optional
---
\`\`\`

Update status with: \`lspec update <spec> --status in-progress\`

## Workflow

1. **Discover context** - Run discovery commands
2. **Search existing specs** - Find relevant work
3. **Check dependencies** - Run \`lspec deps\` if applicable
4. **Create or update spec** - Document your work
5. **Implement changes** - Keep spec in sync as you learn
6. **Update status** - Mark progress
7. **Archive when done** - Clean up workspace

## Quality Standards

- Code is clear and maintainable
- Tests cover critical paths
- No unnecessary complexity
- Documentation where needed (not everywhere)
- Specs stay in sync with implementation

## [Your Project-Specific Guidelines]

[Add your coding standards, conventions, testing requirements, etc.]
```

## Customization

Add project-specific sections:

### Coding Standards

```markdown
## Coding Standards

- TypeScript for all code
- ESLint configuration in .eslintrc
- Prettier for formatting
- Follow existing patterns
```

### Testing Requirements

```markdown
## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Run \`npm test\` before committing
- Maintain >80% coverage
- Use Vitest for unit tests
```

### Architecture Guidelines

```markdown
## Architecture

- Follow clean architecture principles
- Keep business logic separate from framework
- Use dependency injection
- Document architectural decisions in specs/
```
