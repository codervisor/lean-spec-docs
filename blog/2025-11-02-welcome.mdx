# Welcome to LeanSpec!

We're excited to introduce LeanSpec - a lightweight, flexible Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology designed for modern AI-powered development.

{/* truncate */}

## What is LeanSpec?

LeanSpec is built on the principle that **AI coding agents need clear context without overwhelming documentation**. Traditional SDD approaches either lack the detail AI needs or create so much overhead that nobody maintains them.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Write only what matters** - Clear intent AI can act on
- 🤖 **AI-native from day one** - Works with Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Aider, and custom agents
- 📈 **Scale naturally** - Solo dev → Small team → Enterprise
- 🔧 **Built-in workflow support** - Boards, timelines, dependency tracking
- 🎨 **Your structure** - Custom fields, flexible templates

## Getting Started

Check out our [Getting Started guide](/docs/guide/getting-started) to begin using LeanSpec in your projects.

## What's Next?

We're continuously improving LeanSpec based on real-world usage. Stay tuned for more updates!
