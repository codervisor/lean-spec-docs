We've been busy making LeanSpec easier to adopt and more powerful to use. Whether you're exploring spec-driven development for the first time or scaling to enterprise workflows, these updates accelerate your journey from intent to working code.

**What's new**: Example projects for instant hands-on learning, JSON output for automation, simplified templates, and major improvements to our MCP server integration.

## 🚀 Example Projects: Start Learning in Seconds

The best way to understand LeanSpec is to use it. That's why we built **example project scaffolding**—complete tutorial projects you can spin up instantly.

### Three Ready-to-Use Examples

```bash
# See what's available
npx lean-spec examples

# Scaffold an example project
npx lean-spec init --example dark-theme
cd dark-theme
npm install
npm start
```

Each example comes with:
- ✅ **Complete starter code** - A working React app you can immediately build on
- ✅ **LeanSpec already initialized** - Specs, templates, and configuration ready to go
- ✅ **Realistic feature specs** - Real-world examples you can follow
- ✅ **Tutorial-ready** - Designed to work with our [hands-on tutorials](/docs/tutorials/first-spec-with-ai)

#### Available Examples

**`dark-theme`** - Add dark mode to a React app  
Perfect first project. Learn the basics: create a spec, work with AI, track progress.

**`dashboard-widgets`** - Build a customizable dashboard  
Multi-component feature. Practice splitting specs, managing complexity, using sub-specs.

**`api-refactor`** - Modernize a REST API to GraphQL  
Backend-focused example. See how LeanSpec handles architecture changes and migrations.

### Why This Matters

Before example projects:
- "How do I structure a spec?" → Read docs, guess, iterate
- "What does a real spec look like?" → Browse GitHub, adapt to your project
- "Does this work with my AI tool?" → Try, debug, troubleshoot

**After example projects:**
- Clone. Run. Start coding.
- Follow the tutorial with working code.
- See exactly how specs guide AI agents.

No more blank-page syndrome. No more "where do I start?" Just hands-on learning with immediate results.

## 🤖 Better AI Integration

### MCP Server as Standalone Package

We extracted `@leanspec/mcp` into its own npm package. Setup is now cleaner:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lean-spec": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@leanspec/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Desktop, Cline, Zed, and any MCP-compatible tool. The server gives AI agents direct access to your specs—no copy-paste, no context limits.

### Enhanced Dependency Management

New commands make relationship management clearer:

```bash
# Link specs with clear dependencies
lean-spec link feature-123 --depends-on auth-system

# See the full dependency graph
lean-spec deps feature-123

# Remove relationships
lean-spec unlink feature-123 --from auth-system
```

Better validation catches circular dependencies before they cause problems.

## 🔧 JSON Output for Automation

Every major command now supports `--json` for programmatic use:

```bash
# Integrate with dashboards
lean-spec board --json | jq '.columns[] | select(.status=="in-progress")'

# Build custom workflows
lean-spec list --json --status=complete | jq -r '.[] | .name'

# Export for reporting
lean-spec timeline --json > project-timeline.json
```

Use LeanSpec data in your CI/CD pipelines, project dashboards, or custom tooling.

## 📝 Simplified Templates

We removed the Handlebars templating layer. Templates are now **just markdown files** you can edit directly.

**Before**: Edit `.hbs` files → Run build → Test  
**After**: Edit `.md` files → Test

Two templates cover everything:
- **`standard`** (default) - Single-file spec for most features
- **`detailed`** - Multi-file example showing sub-specs in action

No build step, no template engine learning curve. Just markdown.

## 🌏 Professional Chinese Translations

If you're working with Chinese-speaking teams, our docs are now fully localized with professional translations. We've established strict quality guidelines:

- Technical terms stay in English (Spec, CLI, Token, MCP)
- Natural Chinese expression (not word-by-word translation)
- Consistent terminology across all documentation
- Full coverage of guides, tutorials, and API reference

Visit [lean-spec.dev/zh-Hans](https://lean-spec.dev/zh-Hans) to see the Chinese documentation.

## 🎯 Your Path to Getting Started

Not sure where to begin? Here's the recommended path:

### 1. Understand the Why (5 minutes)

Read [Why Your AI Agent Gets Dumber with Large Specs](/blog/ai-agent-performance) to understand the context engineering principles behind LeanSpec.

**Key takeaway**: It's not about fitting in context windows—it's about maintaining AI performance as projects scale.

### 2. Spin Up an Example (2 minutes)

```bash
npx lean-spec init --example dark-theme
cd dark-theme
npm install
```

You now have a working React app with LeanSpec already configured.

### 3. Follow the Tutorial (10 minutes)

Open the [Your First Spec with AI](/docs/tutorials/first-spec-with-ai) tutorial. It walks you through:

- Creating your first spec
- Working with AI to implement the feature
- Tracking progress and completing work
- Seeing how specs guide AI behavior

**Use the example project** you just scaffolded—it's designed for this tutorial.

### 4. Try Your Own Project (whenever you're ready)

```bash
cd your-existing-project
npx lean-spec init
lean-spec create user-authentication
```

Now apply what you learned. Start simple (status + created), add structure as needed (tags, priority, custom fields).

- **Multiple related features**: [Managing Multiple Features](/docs/tutorials/managing-multiple-features)
- **Large projects**: [Large Project Management](/docs/tutorials/large-project-management)
- **Legacy codebases**: [Refactoring with Specs](/docs/tutorials/refactoring-with-specs)

## What's Next

We're focused on making LeanSpec work seamlessly with more AI tools and development workflows:

- **GitHub Copilot Workspace integration** - Native spec support in Copilot's task planning
- **VS Code extension** - Inline spec viewing, validation, and status tracking
- **Project management integrations** - Jira, Linear, and GitHub Projects sync
- **More example projects** - Backend APIs, mobile apps, infrastructure

**Feedback shapes the roadmap**. What would make LeanSpec more useful for your workflow? [Open an issue](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/issues) or [join the discussion](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec/discussions).

## Try It Today

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g lean-spec

# Or use npx for one-off commands
npx lean-spec init --example dark-theme
```

The fastest way to learn is to build. Pick an example, follow a tutorial, see how AI-assisted spec-driven development changes your workflow.
